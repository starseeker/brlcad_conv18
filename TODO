BRL-CAD To Do List
==================

Included below is a list of things that are scheduled or desirable to
be done at some point.  Most recently added items are on top, older
topics are on the bottom.  This is not an official list, it's more a
scratch pad for the developers to use for tracking development ideas
and informal plans.

The items listed for release should not ever hinder, stop, or
otherwise delay a release from being made.  The items listed are
merely to give an estimate of what was expected to be done.  See the
project task tracker for more to do items and future planning efforts.

THESE SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------------------------

* test and release!


THESE SHOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO RELEASE ITERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------

* implement file input support for the pnts primitive

* make color and vectors on pnts work

* rewrite the tables command to not suck

* fix framebuffer refresh bug.  problem was caused when the if_ogl
  framebuffer was changed (back) to request a direct rendering
  context.  presumably that is triggering other code that is failing
  to redraw.

* make sure news2tracker.sh is not missing recent news items.  several
  were missing from a recent report generated (unverified).

* make mged 'inside' command work with geometry being edited

* make mged 'mirror' command work with three args like before with
  last being an axis in order to preserve backwards compatibility

* port g_lint to windows


THESE ARE LOWER PRIORITY OR FOR FUTURE RELEASES
-----------------------------------------------

* implement a obj-g importer

* deprecate either orot or rotobj

* refactor mged's signal handling to make it possible to safely
  interrtupt long-running commands

* add a -color option to all mged commands that draw geometry (B, eid,
  and E come to mind)

* have mged record a timestamped command history by default

* implement -exec support for 'search' command

* make ged command names aware of object arguments for automatic
  globbing and regular expression expansion:
	attr set t 1 [regex .*\.r]
	attr set t 1 [glob *.r]
	attr set t 1 *.r

* mged crashes on Mac if using system Tcl/Tk with our incrTcl.
  crashes with the following stack (same whether dm-X or dm-ogl):
	XQueryExtension
	...
	glxGetConfig
	ogl_choose_visual (dm-ogl.c:1359)
	ogl_open (dm-ogl.c:401)
	dm_open (dm-generic:82)

* review adding support for infix and postfix CSG operators for
  libged/mged.  be sure to revive or at least check out the previous
  effort in src/mged/comb_bool_parse.y that already has support that
  recognizes the classical infix notation.

* readd support for vrml v1 to g-vrml so that users can select whether
  they want v2 (default) or previous v1 output format via a
  command-line switch.  see http://brlcad.svn.sf.net/viewvc/brlcad/brlcad/trunk/conv/g-vrml.c?view=diff&pathrev=22798&r1=16900&r2=16901 

* VRML importer

* make Mac OS X universal binaries actually work.

* implement analyze for all primitives lacking an implementation

* implement general analyze estimate (perhaps just raytrace it) for
  primitives where values like surface area are very difficult to
  calculate.

* move analyze logic into librt (with their respective primitives).

* implement make, ted, edsol, mirror, and analyze for revolve
  primitive.  implement tess() too.

* (re)verify rtarea CPA results (see diff history for patch, fix
  naming convention for presented/exposed area

* ADRT: remove MySQL code, fix ISST callbacks, re-enable RISE, cleanup

* test homovulgaris' root solver patch that puts coefficients in the
  right order

* review librt polynomial root solver (cubic and quadratic case)

* give bot-bldxf the axe (reconcile and merge with bot_dump)

* refactor all of the nmg processing (back) into its own library so
  that external users can manage mesh geometry without needing to pull
  in everything else in librt

* implement support for exporting sketch objects via g-iges

* implement mged object name globbing similar to tclsh's globbing
  (i.e. via a globbing command and quoting globs that use []).  testing
  shows db_glob doesn't seem to behave correctly, at least not like
  glob.  hook globbing into all commands so glob_compat_mode
  statefulness can go away.

* Explore possibility of "level of detail" wireframe renderings,
  possibly using the previous "smooth" wireframe work as a start,
  to provide better visualization of models.

* come up with a new tool that automatically generates "inside"
  regions for a given model as a way to automatically model air.
  particularly useful for bot models where the inside air compartment
  is predominantly (but not entirely) a complex bot structure in
  itself.  idea is to use some sort of marching cubes/tets to find
  those volumes, perhaps use a libified g_qa.

* include tcl and zlib headers in the Windows install

* make including the main headers work for 3rd party apps including
  for C++ projects, working out of the box

* fix metaball "shelling" but that causes the primitive to invert and
  just give paper thin surface (something wrong in the intersection).

* extend metaball control info beyond simple points (e.g., line
  segments)

* address the TODO items in src/mged/clone.c

* investigate why solids.sh fails on three pixels on some 64-bit
  platforms. it grazingly hits/misses a tgc causing a regression
  failure.

* develop a low-level tool for investigating, reporting statistics on,
  and repairing geometry database files.  the tool should nominally
  perform big/little endian conversions, report number and types of
  objects, allow deletion/undeletion/hiding/unhiding, provide some
  general means to manipulate the packed and unpacked .g file data for
  performing low-level modifications

* fix the "(type)(size_t)val" hacks (using ints like ptrs, etc)

* fix rt parallel crash
  (true ; while [ $? -eq 0 ] ; do rt -o /dev/null moss.g all.g ; done)

* fix parallel crash report generation (multiple BU_MAPPED_FILE's
  getting acquired)

* make closing both the command window and graphics window shut down
  mged (i.e., fix unintentional behavior)

* remove hit_normal and hit_point from struct hit.  add RT_HIT_POINT
  macro.  refactor all callers as needed.

* make bombardier actually send the report somewhere

* hook bombardier in for crash reporting

* windows smp support

* modify the new tree traversal code to be generic

* expose nmg_fix_normals through a set of mesh repair routines

* add high dynamic range image support to the framebuffers

* add alpha channel support to the framebuffers

* remote framebuffer timeout support (perhaps as ::key=val;key=val)

* review and integrate David Loman's bot-processing and object label
  scripts, add libdm interface for textual overlay support

* develop a tool that applies a text overlay to a given rendered image
  (e.g., as an rt option) for things like adding an image title, the
  az/el, and objects displayed.

* implement a lighting model for rt that visualizes how expensive each
  individual pixel is to compute with an intensity (heat graph)

* bezier extrusions need to be optimized, really should not be
  performing dynamic memory allocation in the root solver

* better/consistent argument processing supporting both long and short
  option names, perhaps using argtable

* decouple libdm from librt -- just one file in libdm uses librt,
  including a whole nasty primitive switch statement.  need to push
  that back over into librt.

* Implement an optical shader for the new "pixelated" military
  camouflage style

* preserve an arb8 as an arb8 (instead of writing as arb6 or arb5) and
  similarly for the other arb# sizes

* validate primitives during export so that it is guaranteed that
  illegal primitives will not be written to file

* implement a region annointment command where the user can turn an
  assembly into a region and change all lower or higher regions into
  combinations

* enhance dxf-g to create more than just one combination per layer,
  creating multiple objects for the individual objects in the dxf file
  (instead of one conglomerate BoT)

* add an overlap depth reporting tolerance parameter to the
  ray-tracers (similar to -R).

* Generate plain .zip files for Windows binary releases

* fix the variety of ami.tcl and ampi.tcl tclscript warnings/errors

* run indent.sh on directories (one at a time, validating results)

* add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive

* add configuration checks and build system support to disable C++
  outright if necessary, e.g. an --enable-c++ option

* configure support to enable/disable framebuffers, display
  managers, geometry converters, and image converters.  consider
  apache's module management as an example.

* review and merge in the rest of the GSI modifications

* make target and/or script to update ChangeLog and version
  information, possibly including checking for consistency, to
  facilitate release process.

* display the current mode in mged graphics window

* Optional compile-time support for using GMP or CLN for arbitrary
  exact precision arithmetic computation support

* inside/outside point and voxel testing capability in librt

* automatic geometry voxelizer (perhaps using arbs or vol primitive)

* turn geometry converters and image converters into libraries

* add support for querying geometry properties to library including
  computing surface area and weight/mass.

* add verification and validation tests confirming behavior of the
  ray-tracer and computations of area, mass, volume, etc

* testing suite for all binaries: for cmd2 in $(for cmd in `find . -name Makefile.am | xargs cat | perl -pi -e 's/\\\\\n//g'| grep -E "PROGRAMS ?=" | sed 's/.*=//g'` ; do echo $cmd ; done | sort | uniq ) ; do echo command: $cmd2 ; done

* add geometry example of building 238

* Mac OS X SGI dial knobs support

* merge old and 'new' tops behavior into one, preserving compatibility
  where it makes sense.

* ability to "unpush" objects, translating them to a new position and
  applying the correct matrix (using either bounding box or center of
  mass, for example)

* ensure successful build on mingw

* test for USE_FORKED_THREADS in configure

* optimize CSG structures automatically, automatic simplification.

* option to mged make command or new command that enters solid edit
  mode, "med", "smake", "makes", "msed", etc.  same for cp command.

* have libbu report memory allocation statistics so the exact amount
  of memory requirements for a geometry database can be computed on
  the fly via a pre-prep phase.

* support to the raytracers for multiple image file formats,
  recognizing an option and/or the file suffix of the -o filename.

* libfb + font rendering (perhaps through libbn's plot interface) for
  a posix terminal.

* gpgpu for enhanced performance boolweave sorting

* getexecname, "/proc/self/cmdline", program_invocation_short_name.
  separate out into new file.

* geometry viewing commands/visualizations of exploded levels

* librt-based path tracer

* system identifier application with sysctl-style information
  database, with some back-end functionality placed into libbu.

* add callback data parameters to libpkg hook functions

* add performance options for the intel compiler on Altix

* investigate performance impact of using sched_setaffinity and/or
  pthread_attr_setaffinity_np for linux threading affinity in librt.

* rtedge-style tracer that outputs tool paths (splines/segments, etc)
  for CNC/CAM style toolpath cutting descriptions (g-code files).

* rt annotation support

* support for fillets and chamfers as object/combination operations

* make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from
  a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant
  (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

* add dynamic geometry support. i.e. the ability to modify the parsed
  in-memory geometry tree on the fly via api calls (e.g. to add holes)

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

* obliterate verbose compilation warnings

* add support for subgeometry support to the geometry syndicator

* add xml, nff, bzw, pov, blend geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* modify the raytracers to use common fb and file output code

* add missing manual pages (jra generated list on 04.2007):

* design plugin system to allow domain specific tools (say, for example,
  a tool to create propeller parts) to identify themselves and their
  features to BRL-CAD, and to allow BRL-CAD to incorporate those features
  as an integrated part of interaction environments.  

* incremental raytrace-based display manager

* implement tools for generating coils/springs and gears, improve bolt/nut
  tool support


LIBPC
-----

* BNF Parser for generation of constraint objects from expressions

* Make better pc_pc_set, pc_param and pc_constraint structures
instead of the current ugly ones.

* Test constraint solution via Read->Generate->Solve->Update routine

ODDITIES
--------

* the scale structure in bn_cmd_noise_slice (bn_tcl.c) was never
  initialized. it looks like somebody has planned to extend the
  function but never carried out


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL OR ARE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE
--------------------------------------------------

* support for features either as primitives or operations or both
  e.g. chamfer, fillet, round, etc

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

  values, construction history, and timestamping.

* see doc/deprecation.txt for items that have been marked as
  deprecated or available to be removed as obsolete items.

* make struct rt_functab's ft_label bigger and/or dynamic (e.g. vls)

* remove the storage of the never-implemented keypoint parameter for
  extrude objects.


FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED TO SPEED UP RAYTRACING
-------------------------------------------

* merge shot and vshot

* implement bundles shot - array of rays

* separate ray structs - make fit in cache line

* refactor primitive data -  make fit in cache line

* implement SIMD shots
