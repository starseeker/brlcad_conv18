BRL-CAD to do list
==================

Included below is a list of things that are scheduled or desireable to
be done at some point.  More important, easy, and most recently added
items are on top, older topics are on the bottom.


THESE SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE

* handle multiple threading models (irix) via configure

* write up the history of brlcad

* revise cvs policy document to reflect desired and practical public
  use

* obliterate compilation warnings

* clean up code comments, add more of them, and doxygenify them 
  (minimally, use /** */ in major comment blocks)

* add license files and modify file headers

* add checks for system libs and optionally build our libs only if
  they don't have suitable system libs (namely, libtcl)

* add distdir target to Makefile.in files in libtcl/libtk so make
  dist can work.


THESE ARE LOWER PRIORITY

* add support for subgeometry support to the geometry syndicator

* add xml geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* add support for levels of detail

* make benchmarks scale over time by performing multi-resolution
  raytrace iterations of increasing size

* add nfs support and ability to safely interrupt benchmark


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL AND ARE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE

* fix the database IO writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects
