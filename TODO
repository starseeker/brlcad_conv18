BRL-CAD to do list
==================

Included below is a list of things that are scheduled or desireable to
be done at some point.  More important, easy, and most recently added
items are on top, older topics are on the bottom.

THESE SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE

* make opengl optional via configure without editing files

* add checks for termcap and curses to skip building those components

* add checks for urt to skip building it

* add checks for system libs and optionally build our libs only if
  they don't have suitable system libs (namely, libtcl)


THESE ARE LOWER PRIORITY

* consider providing installation and post configuration support
  scripts

* fix reference to a "Create Solid" submenu on pdf page 18 (page 6) of
  volume II

* recheck AquaTk useability so we can decouple mac build from X11

* converter support for common simple formats like nff and bzw

* write up the history of brlcad

* ensure successful build on windows 

* handle multiple threading models (irix) via configure

* obliterate compilation warnings

* add support for subgeometry support to the geometry syndicator

* add xml geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* add support for levels of detail

* add nfs support and ability to safely interrupt benchmark

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

THESE BREAK PROTOCOL AND ARE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

* make benchmarks scale over time by performing multi-resolution
  raytrace iterations of increasing size

TODO items should be formated to column 70 (M-q in emacs), no tabs
