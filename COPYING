Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, documentation,
and build infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers
in the include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin
with the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries are covered by the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation unless noted
otherwise in the source files.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU
Autotools), a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/
directories, and the testing infrastructure are provided either under
a rather unrestrictive BSD-style license or said files are in the
public domain.  Refer to each individual file for specific terms.

Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another
license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.
