BRL-CAD Distribution
====================

BRL-CAD is open source software controlled and maintained by the
BRL-CAD developers.  BRL-CAD is made available under the terms of the
NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA), provided via doc/legal/nosa.txt in
the source distribution.  The NOSA should be referred to for exact
details and clarification of how BRL-CAD may be used, incorporated
into, or otherwise redistributed.

You should have received a copy of the NASA Open Source Agreement
along with this distribution; if not, please write to the Advanced
Computer Systems Team Leader, U.S. Army Research Laboratory,
AMSRD-ARL-SL-BE, Bldg 238, APG, MD 21005-5168 USA.

Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, documentation,
and build infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers
in the include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin
with the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries are covered by the terms of the BRL-CAD NOSA.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, the majority of files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).
All of BRL-CAD's documentation is covered by the terms of the GNU Free
Documentation License.

All of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU
Autotools), a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/
directories, and the testing infrastructure are provided either under
a rather unrestrictive BSD-style license or said files are in the
public domain.  Refer to each individual file for specific terms.

Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another
license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the BRL-CAD
NOSA.

3rd Party Components
--------------------

BRL-CAD includes software code and files that are covered by other
licenses including but not limited to the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) license and the GNU Free Documentation License.
The specific terms of BRL-CAD's licenses should be included in the
doc/legal/ directory of the source code distribution and should be
consulted for more details, information, and implications of each
license.

The BRL-CAD package utilizes and redistributes copies of several 3rd
party source code, libraries, and/or applications.  Said 3rd party
source code, libraries, and/or applications all retain their
respective agreements, licenses, and copyrights and should be referred
to individually for their specific terms.  

When referring to BRL-CAD source code, documentation, and/or
libraries, this is not meant to include or imply 3rd party source
code, libraries, and/or applications unless specifically stated
otherwise.  The majority of the 3rd party source code, libraries, and
applications included with BRL-CAD are located in the src/other/
directory of the source code distribution.
