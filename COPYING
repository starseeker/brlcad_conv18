Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, documentation,
and build infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers
in the include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin
with the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries are covered by the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation
unless noted otherwise in the source files.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).
All of BRL-CAD's documentation is made available under the terms of
the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) as published by the Free
Software Foundation unless otherwise denoted.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU
Build System), a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/
directories, and the testing infrastructure are provided either under
a rather unrestrictive Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license or
said files are in the public domain.  Refer to each individual file
for specific terms.

Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another
license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.

The full text of the GPL, LGPL, GFDL, and BSD license should be
included in the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/
directory.  Refer to the full license text for more details,
information, and implications of each license.

3rd Party Components

party source code, libraries, and/or applications.  Said 3rd party
source code, libraries, and/or applications all retain their
respective agreements, licenses, and copyrights and should be referred
to individually for their specific terms.  

When referring to BRL-CAD, it's source code, documentation, and/or
