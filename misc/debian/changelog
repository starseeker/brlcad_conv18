brlcad (7.18.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  This release includes the initial release of a new Bag of Triangle
  (BoT) editing interface for MGED and Archer.  Nicholas Reed developed
  the new graphical user interface (GUI) in order to consolidate the
  numerous BoT editing commands and processing steps into one unified
  easy-to-use interface.  The new GUI grealy simplifies BoT processing
  steps and can save modelers considerable time.
