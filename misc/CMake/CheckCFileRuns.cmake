# - Check if the given C source code compiles and runs.
# CHECK_C_FILE_RUNS(<file> <var>)
#  <file>   - source code to try to compile
#  <var>    - variable to store the result
#             (1 for success, empty for failure)
# The following variables may be set before calling this macro to
# modify the way the check is run:
#
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link

# Variation of CheckCSourceRuns.cmake that accepts a file path
# to a C source file rather than passing the C code in as the 
# contents of a variable.
