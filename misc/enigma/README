enigma is a one-rotor machine designed along the lines of Enigma but
considerably trivialized.  It is a public domain replacement for the
UNIX "crypt" command.

This version has been upgraded to function properly on 64-bit
machines, as well as providing backwards compatibility with cyprt()
rather than an MD5 version.  Also, this version is modified to detect
illegal salt characters.

Run ./build.sh to process the autotools, configure the build, and
compile engima all in one swoop.  Result should be an enigma binary.
