Checking into some commit quirks flagged by this logic:

14807 - the commit date and message match 6d6d9077d96b7c851b9d98271aeaa1daeb2b34d2, which is where the
SVN label is currently set.  The contents, however, do not match what SVN reports.  (They do match
73d4caa899113a2e28b401b616d1d44832a0bd52, which also matches - and is assigned r14726.)

Resolution - leaving as is



18992 - unassigned in git.  The commit that looks like it has these contents is tagged as 18993
(67c46ada661fdab789632885c34bf77a277962db).  However, 18993 in SVN is a properties commit.

Resolution - update 67c46ada661 to 18992


19261 - unassigned in git.  In SVN this is a "manufactured" commit.  The commit identified as being
a content match for 19261 is 06c6b8ddb02c633f596585538b708924d75c6f0b, which is labeled with r19275.
r19275 has the "libtclhooks" commit message in SVN.

Resolution - leaving as is


19762 - unassigned in git.  Commit with matching content is identified as 19763, which appears to be
the same patch.

Resolution - leaving as is - this looks like it may be the result of a cvs-fast-export processing difference.


19936 - This commit in SVN adds a file.  The corresponding Git commit adding the file is
b5e3e3f1b3fff8b526b80295b8deea35712afc79, which is tagged as 19937.  In SVN 19937 is a property change,
and 19936 is a generated commit to create a branch.

Resolution - leaving as is - Git output is functionally equivalent and looks cleaner.


4737 - flagged as being a match for 4072c1d01d61f24eb4045225a86b6f80d613aea1, which is tagged as 4829.
4737 is a cvs2svn generated commit adding the file, and 4829 is an SVN property change.

Resolution - leaving as is.


4800 - The Git diff and the SVN diff do the same thing in different ways - no issue.


4984 - The Git diff and the SVN diff do the same thing in different ways - no issue.


7879 - Adds a file to a branch.  Git commit b5f00fd6639a1f11aa28c5e4dbcb628499b8d467 has the change,
with a better commit message, which apparently serves for trunk and the branch.  Tagged as r7878, which
corresponds to the commit on trunk.

Resolution - leave as is.
