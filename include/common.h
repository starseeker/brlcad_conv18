 *  This header wraps the system-specific encapsulation of config.h
 *  and removes need to conditionally include config.h everywhere.
 *  The common definitions are symbols common to the platform being
 *  built that are either detected via configure or hand crafted, as
 *  is the case for the win32 platform.
