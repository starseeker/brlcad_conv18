BRL-CAD Contributors
====================

BRL-CAD was originally conceived and written, for the most part, by
the late Michael John Muuss.  He is the original primary architect and
author.  Over the years, the package has been improved upon by many
others.  While Mike is sadly no longer with us, his work lives on in
testament to his intellect and indomitable spirit through the
contributions and improvements by others.  We strive to recognize
those groups and individuals that have helped make BRL-CAD the package
that it is today here.

Contributions are separated into a few major sections depending on the
level of involvement that the individual maintained.  Contributors are
ordered chronologically for each list with the earliest contributors
named first.  Likewise, the most recent contributors are listed at the
bottom.  Names are optionally followed by the organizations that
supported their involvement, also listed in chronological order.

Active developers are denoted with an "**", meaning that they have
been involved within the past 12 months.
