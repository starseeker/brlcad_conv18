BRL-CAD Contributors
====================

BRL-CAD was originally conceived and written, for the most part, by
the late Michael John Muuss.  He is the original primary architect and
author.  Over the years, the package has been improved upon by many
others.  While Mike is sadly no longer with us, his work lives on in
testament to his intellect and indomitable spirit through the
contributions and improvements by others.  We strive to recognize
those groups and individuals that have helped make BRL-CAD the package
that it is today here.

Contributions are separated into a few major sections depending on the
level and type of involvement that the individual maintained.
Contributors are roughly ordered chronologically for each section,
depending upon when involvement with BRL-CAD began.  The earliest
contributors are named first; likewise, the most recent contributors
are listed at the bottom.

Names are optionally followed by the organizations that may have
supported their involvement to some degree, also listed in
chronological order, though many individuals have supported the
package of their own accord and on their own time.  

Active developers are denoted with an "**", meaning that they have
been involved within the past 12 months.
