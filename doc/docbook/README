This directory contains (as of June 2008) an experimental conversion
to docbook of Volume II of the BRL-CAD tutorial series, as well as
the docbook for the OED tutorial.

The default dtd and xsl stylesheets for docbook 4.5 are present
in the resources directory, and it is these copies that are
referenced in the docbook files.

These documents make extensive use of the XInclude modular documentation
specification, and as a consequence the contents of any one particular
"document" may be scattered over many other documents.  This design
direction is intended to allow re-use of standard definitions and
descriptions in multiple documents serving multiple purposes.  When
a definition is updated for one document, re-generation of other documents
will incorporate the update as well without requiring redundant editing. 

Notes:

* When rendered to html output and placed on a server, there may arise
  a problem where the server supplies the page as ISO-8859-1 encoded
  despite them actually using UTF-8.  To combat this problem in the
  case of the Apache web server, an .htaccess file in the directory 
  with the line:

  AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

  should let Apache know to use UTF-8 encoding for these pages.

* xsltproc command examples:

  XML_CATALOG_FILES="../../catalog.xml" xsltproc -nonet -xinclude -o VolumeII.html chunk.xsl VolumeII.xml
  XML_CATALOG_FILES="../../catalog.xml" xsltproc -nonet -xinclude -o creating_a_goblet.html docbook.xsl creating_a_goblet.xml
