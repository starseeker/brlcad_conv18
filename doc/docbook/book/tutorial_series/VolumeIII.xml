      Since 1979, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has been developing
      and distributing the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory -
      Computer-Aided Design (BRL-CAD) constructive solid geometry (CSG) modeling
      package for a wide range of military and industrial applications. The
      package includes a large collection of tools and utilities including an
      interactive geometry editor, raytracing and generic framebuffer libraries,
      network-distributed image-processing/signal-processing capabilities, and
      an embedded scripting language.
    </para>
    <para>
      As part of this effort, a multivolume tutorial series is under development
      to assist users with the many features of the BRL-CAD package. Volume I
      provides an overview of the package contents and installation (Butler and
      Edwards, 2002). Volume II addresses the basic features and functionality
      of the package's Multi-Device Geometry Editor (MGED) and offers a
      comprehensive list of the user commands available (Butler et al., 2001).
      These documents are available for download at
      http://ftp.arl.army.mil/brlcad/ (U.S. ARL, 2003).
    </para>
    <para>
      The purpose of Volume III is to discuss the components of the modeling
      process and suggest principles for maximizing the effectiveness of
      BRL-CAD's capabilities. Because of the large diversity in modeling
      projects, these principles have largely been kept to a general nature so
      that they have the widest applicability possible. In addition, several
      appendices have been included to offer detailed discussions on several
      BRL-CAD tools and features, including the pipe primitive (Appendix A), the
      projection shader (Appendix B), the extruded bitmap primitive (Appendix
      C), the .mgedrc file (Appendix D), the Build Pattern tool (Appendix E),
      and the build_region command (Appendix F).
    </para>
    <para>
      Future volumes in the tutorial series are planned to discuss geometry
      format conversion, advanced modeling features, and programming options.

    <title>The Model Process</title>
    <sect1>
      <title>The Importance of the Model Mission</title>
      <para>
	The key to knowing how to build successful, effective models in BRL-CAD is
	to know why you are building them. Thus, before any measurements are
	taken, before any structures are laid out, and before any geometry is
	built, the modeler should, if possible, meet with program sponsors,
	participants, and/or end users to gain a clear understanding of the
	model's intended purpose--that is, its mission.
      </para>
      <para>
	Whether a model is intended for ballistic analyses, radar studies, or
	something else, the model's mission should be the basis for determining
	how all parts of the modeling process should be conducted. This includes
	the level of detail that the modeler should achieve, the tree structure
	the model should have, the amount of modeling time that should be
	allotted, the types of validation and verification the model should have,
	and even the way documentation should be created and logged. This point
	may seem obvious, but failure to acknowledge the mission can result in
	wasted time and resources and, ultimately, an ineffective model.
      </para>
      <para>
	For example, if one is creating a geometric target description of a combat
	vehicle to simulate a ballistic penetration event, accurately modeled
	material thicknesses and densities of outside armor are crucial in
	analyzing penetration damage. In addition, it is usually important to
	include internal components such as fuel and electrical lines, ammunition,
	and even crew members, which can greatly affect the vehicle's
	functionality if they are impacted by a projectile (see Figure 1).
      </para>
      <para>
	Radar signature studies, on the other hand, often call for a different
	type of model. For the most part, the vehicle's outer shell--or "skin"--is
	what is important, and the previously mentioned armor thicknesses and
	internal components are usually unnecessary (see Figure 2).
      </para>

      </figure>

      <para>
	It is also important to note that some models will need to serve multiple
	missions. If the modeler suspects that this will be the case with a model,
	it should be built to the highest level of detail that any of the intended
	users requires (and, of course, that time/resources permit).

      <title>M-O-D-E-L: A Five-Step Approach to Creating Effective Models</title>
      
      <para>
	After one has explicitly and unequivocally established the "why" of a
	model, the "how" of a model can be addressed. Unfortunately, there is no
	single, universally accepted method to creating models in BRL-CAD. In
	fact, professional modelers are known to employ many unique techniques to
	accomplish equivalent results. Nonetheless, there are several basic steps
	or procedures that are commonly used by most modelers to create accurate,
	realistic, and useful geometric representations in a timely and efficient
	manner. These steps could be described in a variety of ways, but for
	convenience, they can be generalized into the following five categories
	and represented by the acronym M-O-D-E-L:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    M-easuring (or collecting/converting) data,
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    O-rganizing the structure,

	    D-eveloping (or building) geometry,
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    E-valuating (or checking) geometry for correctness, and
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    L-ogging (or creating) documentation.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
	The remaining sections of this document address each of these steps in
	turn.
      </para>

      <para>
	As shown in Figure 3, the modeling process can be thought of as a wagon
	wheel with five spokes. Each spoke extends out from the inner hub--the
	model's mission--and is equally important in giving the wheel its strength
	and functionality. Also, although it is common to consider the steps in
	the order in which they are listed (i.e., M then O then D then E then L),
	the modeling process is dynamic, and it is not unusual for a particular
	phase to occur in a different order, to repeat itself, or to be skipped
	altogether as a project develops.
      </para>

      </figure>
      
      <para>
	For example, the organization phase is often the first step in large or
	complex modeling projects because it helps the modeler establish a tree
	structure that will guide him in collecting/measuring the right (or right
	amount of) data. Also, the modeler often detects missing or inaccurate
	data in the geometry development phase, which requires a return to the
	measurement phase. Finally, in cases involving the conversion of geometry
	from another source, the measurement and development phases might be
	nonapplicable, and a modeler might skip directly to the evaluation phase.

    <title>Measuring data</title>
    
    <para>
      Unless a modeler is creating a conceptually new geometry, he must work
      from a variety of information sources to build a model. In some cases,
      blueprints or mechanical drawings exist. In others, a trip to the field is
      required to physically measure objects and orientations. In still others,
      geometry exists in another CAD format and needs to be converted to BRL-CAD
      format. As shown in Table 1, each type of measurement source has its own
      set of advantages and disadvantages, depending on the modeler's and/or
      user's point of view.

    <para>
      Regardless of the type information source used, there are several simple
      keys to obtaining data. These keys often require a little extra time and
      effort in the early stages of the modeling process, but they can save
      significantly more time and effort later on (especially if multiple
      modelers are involved in the project). Several of these keys are
      identified as follows:
    </para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Leverage all sources available:</emphasis> Although one of the previously
	    mentioned sources may be the primary one from which a modeler will work,
	    all available photographs, drawings, converted geometry, etc., should be
	    used together to spot-check and verify the information given. Sometimes
	    schematics are mislabeled, mistakes are made while measuring, or geometry
	    from other CAD packages does not convert properly. The only way to catch
	    some of these errors is to compare them against another source.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Get information while it is available:</emphasis> With the many data points
	    involved in building complex geometry, it is not uncommon to find during
	    geometry development that not all required information was obtained during
	    the data measurement/collection phase. Important components and/or
	    dimensions can be overlooked, and it may be inconvenient or impossible
	    (e.g., with a combat vehicle) to recollect, remeasure, or reconvert what
	    is missing. Thus, a modeler should be as thorough as possible when
	    obtaining data. Even if it is not clear whether a piece of geometry or
	    measurement will be required, it can always be discarded later if not
	    needed. Also, in the spirit of the carpenter's maxim, it is a good idea to
	    "measure twice and cut once" and double-check measured or converted
	    geometry before it is placed in a model.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Get total lengths and total views:</emphasis> Modelers sometimes take relative
	    measurements of objects across a face without measuring the entire
	    length/width of the face. Unfortunately, at the end, the measurements do
	    not always add up. It is much easier to "back out" missed or inaccurate
	    measurements given total lengths/widths. Likewise, when photographing
	    portions of a bigger object (e.g., a radiator on a truck), it is a good
	    idea to also capture several "bird's eye" views of encompassing objects
	    (e.g., the engine compartment or the entire truck) to help establish
	    overall reference points.
	  </para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      For a series of uniformly spaced objects, it is good practice to      
	      measure the total length of the series and divide by the number of    
	      objects. This helps spread out any inaccuracies along the span and    
	      prevents them from accumulating at the last object. For example, in a 
	      row of 20 bolts at 50-mm intervals, a measurement error of just 2 mm  
	      between bolts could result in the last bolt being nearly 40 mm out of 
	      position.                                                             
	    </para>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Record measurements as clearly and consistently as possible:</emphasis> It is
	    interesting how a "scribble" that is perfectly understandable to the
	    measurement-taker who is still in front of the object can become
	    indecipherable when it is later viewed back in the office (when the object
	    is no longer accessible). Furthermore, despite the best laid plans,
	    projects and personnel can change in midstream, and the person(s) taking
	    measurements may wind up having little or no connection to the person(s)
	    actually interpreting those measurements and building the model.
	    Therefore, all drawings and notations should be sufficiently clear and
	    consistent so that someone unfamiliar with the object could understand and
	    work with the recorded measurements. A few recommendations are given as
	    follows:
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>Include meaningful titles on drawings:</emphasis> Detailed drawings and data can
		  be of little value if it is unclear what the overall geometry/view is and
		  how the designated piece ties into the completed model.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>In general, orient drawings in orthogonal views:</emphasis> This practice
		  eliminates potential problems associated with perspective and makes
		  drawings easier to read and use. If other angles are desired (and it is
		  not a bad idea to include at least one off-angle view with a few
		  measurements to help confirm reference points), be sure to include
		  azimuth/elevation and information about the orientation relative to the
		  eye point and to the actual vehicle coordinate system. In addition, note
		  any atypical configurations and orientations (e.g., a tank turret rotated
		  in an unusual fashion to allow access to certain components).
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>Include offsets from other objects:</emphasis> Although these measurements may not
		  actually be primary data (i.e., required inputs for MGED commands), they
		  may help the modeler resolve problems or derive other measurements needed
		  later. For example, when modeling a field of objects on a flat surface
		  (e.g., gauges and buttons on an instrument panel), it is good practice not
		  only to collect the distances of the objects from, say, the edges of the
		  panel but also the distances relative to other objects. This information
		  can be valuable when trying to troubleshoot overlaps or other problems
		  encountered during the evaluation phase.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>Clearly record small details and symbols:</emphasis> When recording measurements,
		  it is important to remember that even small details (such as arrows,
		  edges, centers, thicknesses, numbers, and units) can lead to possible
		  confusion. Arrows too long or too short can be mistaken for pointing to a
		  shape's edge instead of its center, hastily written numbers can be
		  mistaken for other numbers (e.g., "1" vs. "7"), unidentified inner
		  diameters can be confused with outer diameters, unidentified units can be
		  assumed to be other units, etc. Table 2 lists some standard symbols and
		  abbreviations that are commonly used when recording measurements.

    <title>Organizing the Structure</title>
     <para>
       Taking the time to map out a tree structure of an object before building
       it is another important step in the modeling process, especially if the
       object being constructed is elaborate, if modeling time and resources are
       limited, if the work is being performed as a team, or if the model will be
       passed on to someone else later.
     </para>
     <para>
       If we consider the construction of a house, we know that builders do not
       actually build houses; they build pieces of a house until the completed
       structure emerges. Furthermore, these pieces are not usually built in a
       random order. Rather, a good builder (often as part of a team of
       carpenters, masons, electricians, plumbers, etc.) follows blueprints or
       drawings that group the pieces into categories based on their
       functionality (e.g., framing, wiring, plumbing, etc.) or location (e.g.,
       basement, bedroom no. 1, kitchen, etc.).
     </para>
     <para>
       The modeling process can be thought of in much the same way. Before
       anything is built, a modeler should take on the role of an architect and
       lay out a logical way to break down a potentially complicated object into
       smaller, more manageable pieces. Also, this step can often reveal a
       logical building order (e.g., the drywall does not get installed until the
       wiring inside the walls has been run) as well as identify important
       interconnectivities among parts.
     </para>
     <para>
       The following list provides some tips to achieve good model structuring:
     </para>
     
     <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Use a top-down approach:</emphasis>  It is a good idea to design the structure
	    using a top-down approach, beginning with the largest, most encompassing,
	    or most functionally significant parts/systems and working down from
	    there. Once again, the model's mission is all-important here. If an
	    armored tank is being modeled for a ballistic analysis, the model should
	    probably be structured so that all the pieces connected to the turret are
	    grouped together and, therefore, can move together when the turret is
	    rotated.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Take advantage of established organizational conventions:</emphasis> It is wise to
	    follow any traditional or widely used conventions that might be available
	    in, say, an owner's or operator's manual. If a mechanic or user would
	    normally expect a particular component to be part of a suspension system,
	    then it is wise for the modeler to structure his model accordingly unless
	    there is a good reason to do otherwise.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Use good naming practices:</emphasis> Closely associated with the idea of using
	    good organizational conventions to structure geometry is the idea of using
	    good naming conventions to name geometry. Although naming may appear to be
	    a trivial matter, the fact is that it is not always easy to establish
	    titles and schemes that are intuitive, robust, and useful in helping the
	    end user know where he is in a potentially complex model.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    There are few limitations to how files and objects can be named in BRL-CAD
	    (other than that each file/object name must be unique). However, new
	    modelers soon find that random or haphazard naming schemes lead to
	    inefficiency and frustration. Thus, the following general recommendations
	    are provided to help modelers efficiently organize and track what they
	    build.
	    
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Develop logical schemes, stick to them, and document them: If logical
		  or obvious titling schemes (such as a manufacturer's part names or
		  numbers) are already in place, the user should take advantage of them,
		  especially at the highest assembly levels of "complete" or aggregated
		  objects and especially when multiple modelers are involved. This practice
		  helps establish a logical structure (e.g., all engine parts have a prefix
		  of, say, eng), and many users may already know these names.
		</para>
		<para>
		  Table 3 provides examples of a number of other logical naming conventions
		  traditionally used in BRL-CAD. These conventions include (1) an initial
		  nametag to designate shape/object type or function (i.e., sph for sphere,
		  ant for antenna, and frf for front face); (2) a suffix (or prefix) to
		  designate MGED object type (i.e., .s for primitive shapes [formerly
		  referred to as "solids"], .r for regions, .c for shape combinations, and
		  .a or .g for assembly combinations); and (3) some sort of sequential
		  numbering scheme (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.). For more information on BRL-CAD
		  shapes and modeling levels, see Section 5, as well as Lesson 5 and
		  Appendix C of BRL-CAD Tutorial Volume II (Butler et al., 2001).

		<para>
		  Note that the suffix at the end of names is particularly useful for
		  searching for similar items in large tree structures and for using MGED
		  automation features such as the Build Pattern tool and the build_region
		  command (see Appendices E and F).
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>Keep names short:</emphasis> Prior to BRL-CAD  release 6.0, all BRL-CAD names were
		  limited to 16 characters. In some respects, this "limitation" was useful,
		  compelling new modelers to resist the common urge to name primitives with
		  as much detail as possible. Although the length restriction no longer
		  applies, it is still a good idea, especially in large models (and with
		  frequently used objects), to keep names of objects as short as possible so
		  as to reduce the amount of typing the modeler must do and, thus, reduce
		  the possibility for input errors. In addition, some vulnerability analysis
		  codes do not support names longer than 16 characters.
		</para>
		<para>
		  As shown in Table 3, an exception to the practice of keeping names short
		  includes the names at the assembly combination level and above, where
		  fewer names are used and more descriptive titles can be helpful in
		  designating overall model composition and structure for the end user.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  <emphasis>Establish "reserve" names:</emphasis> In projects that involve multiple modelers
		  developing different pieces of the same geometry, it is helpful in some
		  cases to reserve particular name designations to avoid possible confusion.
		  For example, a team of modelers developing an armored vehicle might choose
		  to reserve the letter "h" to denote the "nametag" for only those
		  components associated with the hull (e.g., "h.s1," "h.s2," etc.). This
		  would mean that those modelers building, say, headlight assemblies would
		  have to choose another designation (e.g., "hlght.s1," "hlght.s2," etc.).
		  This standardization can also be helpful in establishing common
		  terminology for later projects with the same or similar components.

		  <emphasis>Avoid using certain letters and symbols:</emphasis> To avoid potential problems
		  associated with common UNIX notation, searching schemes, and certain
		  survivability, lethality, and vulnerability (SLV) analysis codes, the

		  regarding the use of keyboard characters in BRL-CAD names:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>

		  </listitem> 
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
		      Avoid using special characters. Restrict the use of "+" and """

		  </listitem> 
		  <listitem>

		      Restrict the use of the period to the suffix of MGED object types.

		  </listitem> 
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
		      Avoid using the lowercase letter "l" by itself (to avoid possible

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Include the right amount of detail: The structure should only be as
	    deep as needed for the application. Obviously, every part, no matter how
	    complex, could in theory be reduced down to the atomic or even subatomic
	    level, but how cost efficient and useful would this be? More is not
	    necessarily better. The modeler should use common sense and consult with
	    the end user(s) when deciding how far to break down components and
	    systems. Insufficient detail can diminish the model's usefulness and
	    reduce user confidence, and yet too much detail can unnecessarily drain
	    time and resources, slow down processing time of application codes, and
	    frustrate users who have to wade through many parts that they do not need
	    to get to what they do need.
	  </para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      Note that it is not unusual for a modeler to select relatively        
	      arbitrary names when shapes and parts are first made and then go back 
	      and rename them as the model develops. There are two commands to      
	      rename database objects.
	    </para>
	    <para>                                                                           
	      To rename only the database object, type the following:               
	      <literallayout class="monospaced">
mv  oldname newname                          
	      </literallayout>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that this command changes only the name of a particular object   
	      and not any references to the object that may occur in combinations   
	      throughout the database.                                              
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      To change an object's name and all references to that object, the     
	      mvall (move all) command can be used as follows:                      
	      <literallayout class="monospaced">
mvall oldname newname                       
	      </literallayout>
	    </para>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Use location- and function-based groupings: Components should be
	    grouped based on simple, logical categories such as location and/or
	    functionality. For example, the structure of the simple radio that was
	    built in Lesson 16 of Volume II of the BRL-CAD Tutorial Series (Butler et
	    al., 2001) could be set up in several ways. Figure 4 shows a structure
	    based on location, and Figure 5 shows a structure based on functionality.
	  </para>
	  <figure>
	    <title>Location-based structure of the radio in Volume II.</title>

	    </mediaobject>
	  </figure>
	  <para>
	    The structuring phase, of course, gets trickier and more subjective as the
	    model gets more complex. Regardless of whether the structure is based on
	    location, function, or something else, it is not always clear which parts
	    belong to which structures. In fact, some parts are clearly designed to
	    interface between parts or systems, and so the modeler must choose where
	    he should place them in the tree structure. A consistent treatment of
	    these parts within the model is an important part of the user's ability to
	    understand and use the model.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    It is also important to remember that the tree structure in MGED is
	    independent of the geometry created. The structure is simply a tool to
	    help the user organize and work with the database. Accordingly, the tree
	    structure can be manipulated to suit whatever needs the user(s) may have.
	    Consider the example of a model of a room containing a table and a cup on
	    top of the table. If one wanted to relocate the table (along with the cup)
	    next to a wall, one could create a temporary combination containing the
	    table and the cup. This combination could then be used to move the two
	    objects together to their new location. After the objects are in position,
	    the temporary combination could be "pushed" (see discussion of the push
	    command in Section 5) and then deleted using the kill command (see
	    Appendix A of Volume II [Butler et al., 2001]).

      In the end, the heart of the modeling process is the actual construction
      of the geometry. All the best measurement, organization, evaluation, and
      documentation would be ineffective unless the geometric shapes that make
      up a model are built and built correctly.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Basically, there are two steps to geometry development: (1) <emphasis>creating
      geometry</emphasis>, and (2) <emphasis>positioning geometry</emphasis>. Of course, as with all the other
      phases in the modeling process, there are different schools of thought as
      to how these steps should be accomplished, and each method has its own set
      of advantages and disadvantages.
    </para>

    <para>
      Factors that need to be considered when deciding which methods to use
      include the convenience of building location and manner (e.g., building
      geometry at the origin or in an order that leverages previously defined
      measurements or mathematical calculations); the number of object
      replications that will be needed in the model; the ease of editing one or
      more of the replications; storage space; prep/rendering time; etc.
    </para>

    <para>
      The following are some general tips regarding the efficient development of
      geometry in BRL-CAD:

     <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Build the main structure first:</emphasis> As mentioned previously,  it is a good
	    idea to start building with the "main" object of a model. This could be
	    the largest piece, the piece most central to the rest of the model, or a
	    piece whose location represents a prominent corner or point. Much like on
	    the assembly line of an automobile manufacturer, building the main frame
	    first provides an overall model coordinate system for the rest of the
	    smaller, secondary parts to reference. Also, for projects in which
	    multiple modelers work on separate pieces simultaneously, starting with
	    the main structure allows other pieces to be built in place or put in
	    position immediately upon completion. This practice is more efficient in
	    that it eliminates having extra parts floating around waiting to be
	    positioned, and it provides a better picture of model completion
	    throughout the project.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Know the four modeling levels and their differences:</emphasis> As shown in Table
	    4 (and discussed in Volume II [Butler et al., 2001]), all models built in
	    BRL-CAD are built within the confines of its four modeling levels: (1) the
	    primitive level, (2) the combination level, (3) the region level, and (4)
	    the assembly level. Knowing the characteristics of these modeling levels
	    is one of the first keys to developing effective geometry.

	    experience, users can begin to "see geometry" in a relatively small set of
	    primitives and understand the data needed to produce accurate models.

	    <emphasis>Use the best command to build primitives:</emphasis> In addition to understanding
	    the package's basic building blocks and modeling levels, it is important
	    to understand the behavior and advantages/disadvantages of its basic
	    building "tools" (see Table 6). Using the right building command at the
	    right time can maximize modeling efficiency by, in some cases, taking
	    advantage of data from previously built geometry and saving measurement
	    and/or input time.
	  </para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Build objects in the most convenient location: Although coordinate
	    systems vary according to the type of situation (e.g., converted geometry
	    or group modeling, where a particular orientation has been established),
	    BRL-CAD models are generally centered at the origin (x y z = 0 0 0), where
	    the +X axis is front, the +Y axis is left, and the +Z axis is up.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For objects that are symmetrical in nature, this practice can take
	    advantage of BRL-CAD's mirroring operations and can provide simpler
	    reference numbers for objects that are more complex in composition and/or
	    orientation. In some cases, however, the modeler will find it makes more
	    sense to build objects in place in the model. These include cases in which
	    previously created objects offer convenient reference numbers for the
	    object's location/orientation and cases in which tangencies and other
	    necessary calculations would be more difficult to derive with the object
	    at the origin.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that there are traditional coordinate system conventions that some
	    organizations use for their target descriptions (Ellis, 1992; Robertson et
	    al., 1996; Winner et al., 2002). For a turreted vehicle, the origin is
	    traditionally located at the intersection of the axis of the turret
	    rotation and the ground surface. The +X axis points to the front of the
	    vehicle, the +Y axis points toward the vehicle's left, and the +Z points
	    up (see Figure 6). For a nonturreted vehicle, the axes are the same, but
	    there is no axis of rotation to provide a definitive reference point. So,
	    the origin is located at the intersection of the ground surface and a
	    convenient point along the left-right, mid-plane of the vehicle (see
	    Figure 7). For fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, the axes are the same,
	    but the origin is located on the front nose of the airframe (see Figures 8
	    and 9).

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Build multiple occurrences of objects in the most advantageous manner:</emphasis>
	    Sometimes a modeler will have to make several occurrences of an object.
	    For example, imagine modeling a box of new, identical pencils. Wouldn't it
	    be convenient to take advantage of the similarities involved? There are
	    two basic techniques for constructing such collections. The first involves
	    actually replicating geometry; the second involves referencing shared
	    geometry.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Regardless of the technique used, the modeler typically starts by creating
	    a prototype of the object. In the first technique (illustrated in Figure
	    10), the modeler creates complete copies of the object to be replicated.
	    Each copy is then positioned within the model. In the second technique
	    (illustrated in Figure 11), a "reference" combination that contains only
	    the prototype is created. This combination is then positioned within the
	    model.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    As shown in Table 7, there are tradeoffs to be considered when using each
	    of these approaches. Construction effort is one of them. If the prototype
	    consists of many objects or layers of structure, replication could be a
	    tedious task. In the box of pencils, for example, all of the structure of
	    the pencil would have to be duplicated, including the wood, eraser,
	    barrel, and lead. On the other hand, if the referencing approach is used,
	    then a relatively minor amount of work is needed to create the multiple
	    occurrences.

	  <para>
	    Also, if the modeler wants to make a change to all of the objects (e.g.,
	    sharpening the point of the pencil), then the referencing approach has
	    definite advantages. The prototype object is edited to incorporate the
	    change, and all occurrences automatically reflect that change. However, if
	    only one object is to be modified, then a copy of the prototype must be
	    made, and the reference for that item must now refer to the copy. Not
	    surprisingly, when this type of operation is to be performed often, the
	    replication approach has definite advantages over the referencing
	    approach.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Referencing also has the advantage that it can reduce the amount of disk
	    space needed to store multiple copies of complex objects. The extra space
	    needed to store each new occurrence on disk consists of the transformation
	    matrix and the name of the object and reference combination. This can be
	    significantly smaller than the replication of all the geometry that makes
	    up the prototype.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    It should be noted, however, that because some analysis codes require a
	    unique identifier for each object in the database, some agencies require
	    that all occurrences be replicated to the primitive level without
	    matrices.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	    There are several other tools that can make the duplication process
	    easier--namely, the Build Pattern tool and the keep and dbconcat commands.
	    The Build Pattern tool, which is discussed in Appendix E, can help the
	    modeler automatically generate multiple copies of geometry in rectangular,
	    spherical, or cylindrical patterns. The keep  command can be used to save
	    portions of geometry, and the dbconcat command can be used to concatenate
	    (add) them to other geometries or reinsert them into the existing database
	    as copies.
