<refsect1 xml:id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>zlib</emphasis>
library is a general purpose data compression library.
The code is thread safe, assuming that the standard library functions
used are thread safe, such as memory allocation routines.
It provides in-memory compression and decompression functions,
including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
but other algorithms may be added later
with the same stream interface.</para>

<para>Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough
or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.
In the latter case,
the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
(providing more output space) before each call.</para>

<para>The library also supports reading and writing files in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>gzip</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
(.gz) format
with an interface similar to that of stdio.</para>

<para>The library does not install any signal handler.
The decoder checks the consistency of the compressed data,
so the library should never crash even in the case of corrupted input.</para>

<para>All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
<command>zlib.h</command>.
The distribution source includes examples of use of the library
in the files
<emphasis remap='I'>example.c</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='I'>minigzip.c,</emphasis>
as well as other examples in the
<emphasis remap='I'>examples/</emphasis>
directory.</para>

<para>Changes to this version are documented in the file
