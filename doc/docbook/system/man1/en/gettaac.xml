<refsect1 xml:id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>This program displays an
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>RLE</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
file on a
<emphasis remap='I'>Sun TAAC-1</emphasis>
that is running in single monitor mode under Sunview.
It uses the full 24 bits of color available on the TAAC.
The RLE file is either read from the standard input or
from the file name entered in the control panel.  If the
file name is entered from the control panel,
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>csh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
style tilde expansion and
file name completion are supported.  The control
panel allows the gamma to be set and the file to be
loaded as either a gray scale or rgb image.</para>
