 <para>Allows primitives to be added or removed from a group by selecting
 them on the MGED display using a selection box. Primitives are identified
 by the location of their vertices on the display. For example, a portion of
 a primitive may be within the selection box but if none of its vertices are
 then it is not considered within the section box. Because of this,
 primitives can only be selected if they are displayed in wireframe. Drawing
 a selection box (left to right), primitives completely in the box are
 selected. Drawing the selection box (right to left), primitives completely
 and partly in the box are selected. To start grouper use the command 'gr'
 or 'grouper'. Press and hold the center mouse button then drag the mouse to
 create the selection box. If there are a large number of vertices within
 the selection box, there will be a delay before the selected primitives are
 highlighted and control of MGED is returned to the user. To exit grouper
 mode, hold down the 'ctrl' key and single-click the center mouse button.
 You can also exit grouper mode with the 'dg' or 'done_grouper' commands.
 Primitives in the group, while in grouper mode, will be displayed (i.e.
 highlighted) in yellow wireframe. When entering grouper mode, if the chosen
 group already contains primitives, these existing primitives will be
 immediately displayed in yellow wireframe. As primitives are added to the
 group, they will also be highlighted in yellow. When you exit grouper mode,
 the yellow highlights will be removed.</para>
 <para>Caveats: When primitives are added to the group, they will lose any
 translation matrices used to place them into the position where they were
 selected. A workaround for this would be to use the 'xpush' command to push
 the translation matrices down to the primitives before using grouper.</para>

          As primitives are selected using a selection box, the names of the
          primitives can be listed. This option controls the number of
          entries which will be listed. By default this value is zero. All
          selected primitives will be listed, assuming the 'ListLimit' is
          high enough, even if they are not added to the group. This will
          happen if some of the selected primitives are already in the group.
