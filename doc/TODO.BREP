BREP TODO
=========

Included below is a basic work breakdown related to the implementation
of boundary representation (BREP) support in BRL-CAD.  Feel free to
add to or expand this list and/or embellish it with additional
information as appropriate.  If you would like to work on the BREP
implementation, send a note to the brlcad-devel mailing list.

This file is a general scratch pad for categorizing and itemizing BREP
implementation tasks.  It is not an implementation plan.

This is a work in progress.


Geometry Entities
-----------------

point
line  (e.g., line segment, ray, bidirectionally infinite line)
line set  (e.g., polyline, polygon)
curve  (e.g., spline, arc, circle, ellipse)
plane
surface (e.g., spline, polygonal)
surface+curve  (i.e. a trimmed surface)
solid
