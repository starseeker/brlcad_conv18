BRL-CAD Deprecation Log
=======================

Included below is a deprecation log and notes for BRL-CAD API changes
that potentially impact developers.  The general practice is that
public API changes may go from deprecated to obsolete during one of
the following events:

a) during a major release
    (e.g. going from 7.*.* to 8.*.*)
b) during a minor release provided that
    1) change was publicly announced as deprecated beforehand
    2) sufficient deprecation warning was been given
	i) at least three minor releases have passed since deprecation
	ii) at least three months have passed since deprecation

Ideally, if a change is the addition of new routines, the change
should be implemented in an addtive fashion that preserves existing
functions and behavior as much as possible.  If the change will
intentionally replace or remove routines, then those routines should
be then marked as deprecated.

Marking routines as deprecated can be done during compile-time with
#warning pre-processor declarations or during run-time with printing
statements.

The items listed below are items that deprecated and/or now obsolete.
