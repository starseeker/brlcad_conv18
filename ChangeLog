	* HACKING:
	Yet another massive rewrite/modification.  This time expand the document to include details relevant to all contributors, not just developers, so that the file is applicable to anyone with commit access (with particular attention to documentation writers).  Also, finally include some details on where we stand with C++ and clarify a lot of statements throughout with respect to style, conventions, and requirements.

	* m4/args.m4:
	record whether a configure option was set or not since it may be set yet still be the default

	sgi knobs and example geometry are pushed back as (sigh) clone still isn't done and EF plugin and archer are going to require considerably more attention.  prepare for 7.8.2 release, nothing left to do.

	* doc/README.IRIX:
	no longer need to disable blt, build problem fixed (simple cast)

	* src/other/blt/src/bltInit.c:
	Tcl_GetAssocData returns a Clientdata, so have to cast to long to avoid mipspro type check failure

	* m4/epsilon.m4:
	so far, only freebsd seems to use doubles for floats .. so revert the leniancy and report when implementations deviate from what should be expected from IEEE compliance.

	* sh/shtool:
	treat screen as vt100, avoid the error message about determining how to do bold

2006-06-02  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-var.c:
	follow the style guidelines, use K&R/Java style braces/indents not BSD. ws.

	* src/conv/g-var.c:
	crazy dev trickling variables throughout as if this were c++ code.  add a local var footer and remove reference to non-existant codebase.  fix header inclusion too.

	* regress/spdi.sh: using == is not portable

2006-06-01  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	avoid passing additional format arguments to fprintf() to avoid potential buffer allocations. very nominal benefit, but can conceivably help with certain crashes and implementations of fprintf().

	* src/libbu/ispar.c:
	gah, reduce the massive WIN32 block to just the section that mattered so that kill() is not invoked on a bu_bomb().. should eventually contain a WIN32-esque method for killing a parent process gracefully ala kill()

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	avoid incrementing the dbi_uses counter directly -- do a clientless clone of the dbip instead

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	allow for clientless cloning and closing of dbip instances where only the uses count is of interest.  no need to stash null clients even though the ptbl will record them, just ignore them.

	* src/librt/g_submodel.c:
	remove bad commented-out increment of the dbi_uses.  it might benefit to just clone the dbi, but seems unnecessary for a plot routine

2006-06-01  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	do not close a mapped file while the database instance is still in use
	as db_clone_dbi does not increment dbi_mf->uses

2006-06-01  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Mods to remove the expand button when in "Basic" mode. There's also a minor tweak of the aboutDialog's size.

2006-05-28  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKING:
	add a new section on developer responsibilities outlining what is expected of them.  add details on header organization, usage of the K&R indentation style (aka java/gnu style), and routines in libbu that should be used for portability reasons.  more on the coding style in general.

	* COPYING:
	make it more clear that the package as a unified work is GPL though separate portions of the package are released under different licenses.  refer to the development control structure and refer to HACKING.  provide a point of contact.

	ugh, removed horrible usage of vls strings for things that can just be string constants.  also takes care of a memory leak as the vls was never released.  thanks to jim monte for noticing the problem.

	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	jim monte noticed that using a vls here was unnecessary for the Tcl_LinkVar'ing of glob_compat_mode and output_as_return

	* configure.ac:
	typo, should have been profile not debug -- logic is still wrong though, needs to be redone for --enable-profile

	* src/libbu/color.c: duplicate defines for RED/GRN/BLU

	* NEWS:
	s/tesselation/tessellation/ typo.  add emphasis to the extent of John's dxf importer enhancements

2006-05-12  twingy  <twingy@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c:

	Minor tweek to anchor the edit panel north

2006-05-01  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	john continues on his dxf-g rampage with manpage enhancements and additional support to dxf-g for ELLIPSE entities.  earlier he added support for LWPOLYLINE, MTEXT, LEADER, ATTRIB, SOLID, and ATTDEF entity states -- all grouped into one news entry for dxf-g enhancements.

	* NEWS:
	fixed asc2g bug reading files with carriage returns.  if you attempted to run asc2g on a .asc file that came directly from the windows platform and had embedded carriage returns ('\r'), it would incorrectly parse the v4 I units version string dumping out a wierd undecipherable overlapping error (printing the carriage return), now it handles them correctly.

	* NEWS: added dbupgrade manual page.  one didn't exist

	* NEWS:
	updated the g2asc manual page with format details.  the manpage still talked about it being necessary for platform independent conversions, language and details were updated to note that this is no longer the case (that the binary will work just fine).  also mentions that binary and ascii are open specs, though ascii is subject to deprecation change without notice whereas the binary is not. also that the ascii should not be relied upon by external developers but that it is currently a tcl command script.

	* NEWS:
	fixed g_diff attribute comparison issue.  when doing a g_diff, attributes were not being compared in order if the db command fails to tclify the exported version resulting in a binary 'these objects seem to differ' when they did not.  the tclification was improved so it can perform a proper ordered attribute comparison under more cases.

	* NEWS:
	g_diff reports more detail whether differences exist.  if the external forms are being compared, it will report whether the lengths differ or the contents (previously was an unknown either/or difference).  also g_diff will summarize and actually say that it found no differences instead of just ending a statement like there is something more like the following:

	* NEWS:
	g2asc now saves additional _GLOBAL attribute values.  previously, only the units and title were exported so that if a user had manually added additional attributes they were not being saved, now they are saved as attr commands in the ascii format.  (a situation where this was important was where a 'disclaimer' and 'description' attribute were added in addition to the title.

	* NEWS:
	fixed g2asc export of null units bug.  there was a situation where the current units could not be determined and a (null) was export to the ascii file.  this would halt an asc2g.  if the units cannot be determined, they are not output (i.e. no (null)) now.

	* src/conv/Makefile.am: add new dbupgrade.1 manpage

	* src/conv/dbupgrade.c: ws, indent

	* src/conv/asc2g.c:
	add support for carriage returns so old ascii files copied from windows parse correctly.  use a little less emphatic emphasis on error (!!!)

	* src/conv/dbupgrade.1:
	initial manual page for the dbupgrade command, basic usage info

	* src/conv/g2asc.1:
	update the manpage with more up-to-date information and details.  mention that current format is a tcl script, that the conversion to ascii isn't strictly necessary any longer since v5 format is portable, and that the ascii format should not be used by external codes.

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	comments, remove dead new proc creation code (there's a func for that creating a wdbp function object)

2006-04-30  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/dxf-g.1, src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	Added support for ELLIPSE entities, added a bit more logging, updated
	man page.

2006-04-30  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	fix the mged logging so that it actually works now and consistently writes events.  clean up the whitespace while refactoring the closure of a db to f_closedb() consistently.

2006-04-29  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_diff.c:
	let the user know if there are no differences and be more specific on difference when external representations differ.

	* src/conv/g2asc.c:
	if the _GLOBAL object has attributes set other than units and title, write them out.  also make sure the units are not (null) before writing them out.

	* src/conv/asc2g.c:
	default units to millimeters instead of aborting if the units specified are unknown

	* db/Makefile.am, db/toyjeep.asc:
	add an toy barbie (tm) jeep (tm) modeled in 2005 over the course of a day by a group of students attending a BRL-CAD (tm) training course at SURVICE

2006-04-28  BRL-CAD  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/pipe.c:
	wdb_export frees the pipe structure; consequently, do not touch it afterwards

	Updates to make it easier to check the status of a regression test.  Each test
	now reports its notion of whether it succeeded or failed.

	* regress/Makefile.am, regress/slave_build.sh:
	Make sure directory has been created (slave_build.sh) or wait for it.

	Indicate that the regression test is done, but not whether it was successful or not. (Makefile.am)
