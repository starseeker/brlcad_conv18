2009-05-11 21:12  brlcad

	* [r34496] HACKING:
	  update the version before updating the changelog so the change is
	  recorded

	* [r34495] NEWS:
	  bob sneaks in support for ehy interactive editing in archer along
	  with that which was added for arb8, tor, and ell.

2009-05-11 20:58  brlcad

	* [r34494] src/librt/primitives/mirror.c:
	  odd ws snuckage

2009-05-11 20:17  brlcad

	* [r34493] configure.ac:
	  all -build options should default to 'auto', including step. if
	  the user specifically requested step and parser/lexer aren't
	  present, abort.

2009-05-11 19:54  brlcad

	* [r34492] configure.ac:
	  need to force compilation of step off if there are no
	  parsers/lexers found since there is a parser in libexpress.
	  avoids compile-time failure on minimal systems.

2009-05-11 19:25  bob1961

	* [r34491] src/libged/Makefile.am, src/libged/ged_private.h,
	  src/libged/pscale.c, src/libged/scale_ehy.c,

	* [r34489] src/libged/ged_private.h, src/libged/pscale.c,
	  src/libged/scale_ell.c, src/libged/scale_tor.c:
	  Included rtgeom.h in ged_private.h, modified the signatures of
	  ged_scale_ell() and ged_scale_tor() (i.e. removed matp_t
	  parameter). Also fixed pscale (it wasn't working when matrices
	  were found along the path).

2009-05-08 20:06  starseeker

	* [r34486] src/libged/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Add pscale.c to CMakeLists.txt

	* [r34480] TODO:
	  expand on CSG optimize task (probably should be multiple, but
	  good enough for now)

2009-05-08 18:46  brlcad

	* [r34479] TODO:
	  the tops behaviors were merged with the old form formally
	  deprecated. in 7.14.4

2009-05-08 18:44  brlcad

	* [r34478] TODO:
	  screw it, c++ is requisite given the BREP integration, GS and GE
	  plans, and the new modeler.

2009-05-08 18:42  brlcad

	* [r34477] TODO:
	  had it in mind for years now to record a matrix above all
	  primitives (akin to putting each primitive into their own comb)
	  so that all primitives will retain a local coordinate system by
	  default (where their V stays at 0,0,0). this will help primitives
	  like the torus support non-uniform scaling without screwing with
	  the implicit form of a torus.

2009-05-08 18:37  brlcad

	* [r34476] TODO:
	  the polygonal NMG -> ON BREP is actually more important than old
	  bspline/nurbs NMG -> ON BREP so just stub out the goal for both.
	  'not suck' is too nondescript for the tables command (don't
	  remember what that meant, and I wrote it). erik exposed
	  nmg_fix_normals so remove from list.

2009-05-08 18:32  brlcad

	  this release iteration (3 weeks remaining) with coverage across
	  at least 5 devs. pnt improvements, step-g progress, archer
	  updates, functab refactoring, and adrt views.

2009-05-08 18:15  brlcad

	* [r34473] NEWS:
	  note that bob improved the interactive editing support in archer
	  adding support for mouse-based editing of arb8's torii and
	  ellipsoids

2009-05-08 18:09  brlcad

	* [r34472] NEWS:
	  keith improved asc2g so that it will import even larger bots
	  before running out of memory (and import faster). he made it
	  chunk in input into manageable sizes and being more memory
	  efficient. this was in response to sf feature request 2750772
	  from dwaynelk (asc2g fails on large/complex bots)

2009-05-08 17:43  erikgreenwald

	* [r34471] src/adrt/libtienet/tienet_master.h,

2009-05-08 17:25  brlcad

	* [r34470] TODO:
	  no longer using the horrible old/former/obsoleted sf task
	  tracker, so don't reference it. instead just point to the
	  trackers and be more succint on what the purpose of this file is
	  and how the devs use it. refer to the task backlog as a backlog.

2009-05-08 16:04  bob1961

	* [r34469] include/common.h, include/config_win.h, src/fb/fbfade.c,
	  src/proc-db/terrain.c, src/proc-db/vegitation.c:
	  Consolidate the necessity to provide a simulation of drand48() to
	  one place.

2009-05-08 15:56  brlcad

	* [r34468] TODO:
	  unbroked. last call for commits.

2009-05-08 15:55  brlcad

	* [r34467] src/librt/primitives/mirror.c:
	  that 2.0 scaling factor was rather important so that the object
	  is translated across the mirror point far enough. fixes a bug
	  introduced with the r34263 elimination of the offset as a
	  separately tracked value.

2009-05-08 14:22  brlcad

	* [r34466] Makefile.am:
	  ah, so the cmakecheck is running but just not halting (depending
	  on the version of make) when the script reports an error. make it
	  stop so that an out-of-sync CMakeLists.txt file will cause a
	  distcheck failure.

2009-05-08 14:17  d_rossberg

	* [r34465] src/libged/CMakeLists.txt, src/librt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  stay in sync with Makefile.am

2009-05-08 12:07  indianlarry

	* [r34464] src/conv/step/Makefile.am:
	  removed fedex_src dependency

2009-05-08 01:24  brlcad

	* [r34463] src/conv/Makefile.am:
	  patch-g.1 and rpatch.1 are missing from the install and dist

2009-05-07 23:40  brlcad

	* [r34462] src/proc-db/vegitation.c:
	  cleanup

2009-05-07 23:26  erikgreenwald

	* [r34461] src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiSelect.cc:
	  ok, ok, NULL is not necessarily 0.

2009-05-07 23:23  erikgreenwald

	* [r34460] src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiSelect.cc,
	  src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiSelect.h:
	  Change the exists() method to return a bool. This only seems to
	  be
	  used in that capacity and causes 32/64b issues by using the
	  address
	  as "true" and NULL as "false".

2009-05-07 23:11  brlcad

	* [r34459] src/proc-db/terrain.c:
	  massive cleanup and refactor of the nurbs terrain example. fix a
	  memory corruption and eliminate all globals.

2009-05-07 20:36  brlcad

	* [r34458] src/proc-db/terrain.c:
	  should be the other way around. rand_s() is very windowsy. some
	  minor ws cleanup too.

2009-05-07 20:35  indianlarry

	* [r34457] src/conv/step/Makefile.am:
	  reverting back to revision 34408 to fix distcheck on
	  cruisecontrol will clean up monday

2009-05-07 20:33  brlcad

	* [r34456] src/proc-db/terrain.c, src/proc-db/vegitation.c:
	  ya killin' me bob. revert r34450. HAVE_DRAND48 is now defined per
	  config_win.h so shouldn't need all that hackery and code
	  duplication. if you need the same code in more than one place,
	  it's the wrong way.

2009-05-07 20:19  bob1961

	* [r34455] include/common.h, include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  Mods for building on Windows.

2009-05-07 20:18  brlcad

	* [r34454] include/config_win.h:
	  it's provided as a define for windows, so define HAVE_DRAND48 to
	  true

2009-05-07 20:17  brlcad

	* [r34453] src/fb/fbfade.c:
	  it's already wrapped, kinda silly to double-wrap it

2009-05-07 20:15  brlcad

	* [r34452] src/fb/fbfade.c:
	  consistency cleanup, remove ancient irrelevant docs

2009-05-07 19:23  brlcad

	* [r34451] NEWS:
	  this one is borderline user-visible but does impact the
	  style/appearance of mged and archer so go ahead and mention it.
	  bob worked on converting several/many of the widgets in archer
	  and a couple in mged over to using the new tk 'ttk' widgets. ttk
	  is a new modular themable widget system developed for tcl/tk 8.5.
	  these new widgets even further make BLT unnecessary.

2009-05-07 19:06  bob1961

	* [r34450] src/proc-db/terrain.c, src/proc-db/vegitation.c:
	  Do an #ifndef drand48 before defining a drand48 function.

2009-05-07 18:37  bob1961

	* [r34449] src/fb/fbfade.c:

2009-05-07 18:35  bob1961

	* [r34448] include/raytrace.h:
	  Put back declarations for rt_pipept_print and
	  rt_metaballpt_print.

2009-05-07 18:33  bob1961

	* [r34447] src/librt/primitives/metaball/metaball.c:
	  Have rt_metaball_point_value_metaball return something to make
	  the compiler happy.

2009-05-07 17:30  bob1961

	* [r34446] include/ged.h, src/libged/Makefile.am,

2009-05-07 15:51  bob1961

	* [r34443] misc/win32-msvc8/librt/librt.vcproj:
	  Modified the windows build file for librt (i.e. mirror.c and

2009-05-07 15:46  bob1961

	* [r34442] misc/win32-msvc8/libged/libged.vcproj:

	* [r34441] src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiSelect.cc,
	  src/other/step/src/clstepcore/sdaiSelect.h:
	  Changed a return type from int to long in order to support
	  building on 64bit hardware.

2009-05-07 13:00  brlcad

	* [r34439] src/conv/step/Makefile.am:
	  annotate three FIXME's in this file that should help with the
	  distchecking and build cleanup

2009-05-07 11:48  indianlarry

	* [r34438] src/conv/step/Makefile.am:
	  fixing step-g build

2009-05-07 03:42  brlcad

	* [r34437] src/librt/primitives/pipe/pipe.c:
	  ws indent style cleanup plus consistently wrap all of the (*nh)
	  to be encased consistently in wraps.

2009-05-06 22:56  starseeker

	* [r34436] NEWS, src/librt/primitives/pipe/pipe.c:
	  Fix bug where raytracing of pipe was crashing if duplicate hit
	  points showed up - incorrect decrementing of *nh was the problem.

2009-05-06 22:54  starseeker

	* [r34435] BUGS:
	  Hmm - Sean spotted where nirt doesn't parse the -e option very
	  well in MGED - space between -e and quote character fails

2009-05-06 21:51  brlcad

	* [r34434] BUGS:
	  finally was able to reproduce john's error message about
	  tab-completion giving a bind error. seems as though it only
	  sometimes happens, even for -c mode, depending on whether the
	  currently running mged finds tcl resources? either way, it does
	  exist... :)

2009-05-06 19:15  brlcad

	* [r34433] src/libged/scale_ell.c:
	  add comments about how scale_ell seems to be a bad direction to
	  go in as it's specific to a primitive's internal structure (no
	  command should need to know the internal structure of any
	  primitive) and specific to a scaling operation. all objects
	  already define a matrix transformation callback that implements
	  this same logic.

2009-05-06 17:56  brlcad

	* [r34432] NEWS:
	  thought this was already the case, but maybe not.. the
	  dbconcat/concat command no longer requires an affix, allowing it
	  to default to behave as if '/' was specified if no prefix/suffix
	  is provided.

2009-05-06 14:52  brlcad

	* [r34431] TODO:
	  I apparently broke mirroring a few days ago while refactoring,

	* [r34430] src/librt/primitives/mirror.c:
	  begin migration towards using the rt_*_mirror() interface,
	  setting up the mirror plane equation needed by the primitive.
	  stubbed in for the moment until a bug is fixed (likely introduced
	  during r34263 refactoring)

2009-05-06 00:00  brlcad

	* [r34424] src/librt/Makefile.am,
	  src/librt/primitives/tor/tor_mirror.c:
	  break out a tor_mirror() routine using the logic nearly identical
	  to what is happening now in rt_mirror() with the exception of
	  using a plane_t instead of pt+dir (so we still reconstruct pt+dir
	  for now). first step towards a new primitive rt_###_mirror()
	  callback on all primitives that takes an rt_db_internal and a
	  plane to mirror across.

2009-05-05 22:08  brlcad

	* [r34422] include/vmath.h:
	  instead of referring to the 4th component of a plane_t as [3],
	  refer to it as [W] given it's effectively a homogeneous component
	  for the normalized plane equation vector. aside from that, code

	  Need src/conv/step in the list for Makefile generation. Attempts
	  to build as of r34379 seems to suggest that there are missing

	  build - ssince src/conv/step is currently keying off the
	  BUILD_STEP variable (which bty it shouldn't do that forever - in
	  theory it should check for a system install if BUILD_STEP is off)
	  turn off STEP altogether until it the rest of the necessary files

	* [r34156] regress/Makefile.am, regress/testlib.c:
	  add a stubbed out library tester. far from complete, but it
	  already is a proof-of-concept for loading a library and
	  loading/testing symbols within that library.

	* [r34155] TODO:
	  integrate a library tester into the regression suite. would be
	  good to have a simple dynamic loading tool that will take a built
	  library and compare the symbols its header says should be there.
	  moreover, we could make sure those functions will also run (with
	  zero/null arguments) without crashing. quick test shows that this
	  should be entirely feasible and should uncover a lot of
	  inconsistency cleanup.

	* [r34150] BUGS:
	  verified another bug in the facetize -n commmand with lee where
	  it is giving spurious 'color index out of range' errors on (at
	  least) some 3-manifold surfaces. the painting algorithm in
	  nmg_manif.c seems incomplete/flawed.
