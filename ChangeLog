	* [r33957] NEWS:
	  bob fixed a bug in mged where the last character would end up
	  getting ignored. the only key combination he found that produced
	  that behavior was a control-key-slash binding. overriding the
	  binding (to do nothing) fixed the issue for bob. no word yet from
	  peter_gillissen that reported this bug as sf bug 2555653
	  (Neglecting last character command-line).

	  make the 'make' command use the existing view size when creating

	  this is a change to make's behavior when there are no objects
	  displayed since previously, it would create an object sized to
	  the view, but then autoview to size the view out. this would
	  result in unexpected view changes that would get compounded if

	  reword the line item about bob fixing the mged font preferences
	  menu so it can be annotated that the fix relates to sf bug
	  2596276 (can't change fonts) by victor cericole. this change
	  reportedly fixes that problem.

	* [r33798] regress/Makefile.am:
	  regression rule depends on Makefile?

2009-02-18 07:38  brlcad

	* [r33797] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.in:
	  missing ( typo on uninstall rule

2009-02-18 07:24  brlcad

	* [r33796] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  note that pkg now uses size_t just in case even though it's a
	  minor castable change

2009-02-18 07:21  brlcad

	* [r33795] include/pkg.h, src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  use size_t where lengths are expected since c89 provides for it
	  (alas not ssize_t though). quell Wall warnings too while we're at
	  it.

2009-02-18 06:33  brlcad

	* [r33794] src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  last bit of reordering for a few remaining forward decls

2009-02-18 06:30  brlcad

	* [r33793] src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  big reordering cleanup to avoid forward decls. doxygenify
	  comments, use snprintf on errbuffrage.

2009-02-18 06:10  brlcad

	* [r33792] src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  style and ws consistency cleanup

	* [r33790] src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.in:
	  missing semi

2009-02-18 03:38  brlcad

	* [r33789] src/other/tcl/Makefile.am,
	  src/other/tkhtml3/Makefile.in:
	  uninstall refchan.n and tkhtml.n to try to fix distcheck. looks
	  like tk renamed reflectedchan.n to refchan.n which raises
	  question of why tk's uninstall logic is in tcl's Makefile.am.

2009-02-18 01:18  starseeker

	* [r33788] src/proc-db/spring.c:
	  Start figuring out what's needed to model the various types of

2009-02-17 21:49  bob1961

	* [r33787] include/bn.h, src/libbn/mat.c:
	  Added bn_mat_print_vls().

2009-02-17 21:41  erikgreenwald

	* [r33783] src/mged/points/points_parse.y,
	  src/mged/points/points_scan.l:
	  aha, here be a couple of the lil buggers are that are messing
	  with ohloh stats. these files were missed by the gpl->lgpl
	  conversion over a year ago because of their extension.

2009-02-16 09:18  d_rossberg

	* [r33777] src/libged/CMakeLists.txt:
	  additional include directory because of new TCL version

2009-02-14 07:34  brlcad

	* [r33774] src/libged/ged.c, src/libged/qray.c, src/mged/mged.c:
	  fix some of the initialization and shutdown problems including
	  the qray vls one. the problem was a set of pointers in the gedp
	  that were getting freed/closed but weren't being set to null so
	  the second use of that gedp erroneously would try to use the old
	  pointer (and crash).

2009-02-14 07:05  brlcad

	* [r33773] TODO:
	  cliff has the task of exhaustive mged testing close enough to

2009-02-14 07:02  brlcad

	* [r33772] TODO:
	  looks like the mged Open->File bug is fixed, but it still fails
	  to initialize mged something awful.

2009-02-14 05:00  brlcad

	* [r33771] NEWS, src/tclscripts/mged/edit_solid.tcl:
	  and here I thought I'd already tested and committed this fix for
	  7.14.0 but apparently never did. this is a fix that makes the
	  Primitive Editor work again without popping up an error about the
	  switch statement having a problem. it's a stupidity in switch
	  that can't handle comments between the case blocks. someone
	  reported this but I can't find a reference to it anywhere atm.

	  Problem with MGED starting up was due to errors getting returned
	  by ged commands if a database was not open, despite this being a
	  valid state to attempt commands. The fix is two-fold. First,
	  glob.c has had its logic for checking on the state of the
	  database moved to where it actually needs it - the regexp
	  matching part. Second, if the wdbp is null return OK, and do this
	  BEFORE the database open check. It may be that some libged
	  commands will need to make the latter check as well - qray does
	  in testing.
