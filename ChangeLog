	  set of plate mode NURBS objects. This provides a mechanism for
	  'converting' to plate mode from solid, but without having to
	  implement any sort of flag - the underlying BRep data types are
	  in fact representing plate mode objects when written back to the
	  .g file. Two modes - one puts the specified set of faces (all by
	  default) into a single multi-plate BRep object, and the other
	  produces a comb unioning one-brep-per-face plate mode BRep
	  objects. The advantage of the latter is an ability to
	  individually inspect and remove specific faces.

	  src/libbg/tri_tri.c:
	  Putting in a secondary testing function for now since I'm not
	  100% sure of this, but it looks as though the coplanar tri-tri
	  test is doing an insufficient check for whether triangles are
	  fully contained and is returning a false positive for contained
	  in the edge intersection case... I could see it if the area test
	  picked up on the super-thin sliver of the edge, but what seems to
	  be happening is the single point-in-triangle test checking for
	  triangle-in-triangle is insufficient - one or two of the edge
	  points might report marginally inside, but manifestly neither of
	  the triangles is inside the other so per the source comment that
	  portion of the test shouldn't be returning true, unless I'm
	  missing something.

	  it is wrong in that it's not happy when it gets two triangles on
	  a single face on a closed edge, which is right, but we clearly
	  have a lookup failure on a triangle with one edge vert using a

	  may not intrude into the other mesh associated triangles using
	  that vert might. The proposed method of correcting those
	  situations needs aligned vertices, so try to make sure we will

	  visual inspection of the shapes - adding a lower level call to
	  the nirt logic in libanalyze, we can detect when those specific
	  shots are hitting or missing incorrectly. The nirt API is
	  probably much too heavy for this, but it's I/O logic was already
	  specifically set up to read in floating point strings at high
	  fidelity for a similiar situation where we needed to exactly
	  reproduce rays from string inputs. The example added is a case in
	  NIST3 that illustrates an unexpected hit with the current trunk

	* [r74400] misc/tools/env2c/env2c.cxx, src/libged/env.c:
	  refactor env cmd logic

	* [r74399] doc/legal/embedded/CMakeLists.txt,
	  doc/legal/embedded/whereami.txt, src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/dir.c, src/libbu/whereami.c, src/libbu/whereami.h:
	  Use Gregory Pakosz's whereami wrapper file to replace the
	  deprecated bu_argv0_full_path function for internal brlcad_root
	  resolution of directories in bu_dir. For this to work reliably
	  bu_getiwd isn't enough - if we launch in a directory that
	  doeesn't happen to give use the right seed path, we still won't
	  find anything. whereami attempts to encapsulate the platform
	  specific logic necessary to make this work. Using this setup,
	  bu_dir bin works in testing on Linux regardless of current
	  working dir or initial working dir. It even works if we put the
	  build/bin dir into the shell's path and launch with no path info
	  at all in the executable invocation.

	* [r74398] CMakeLists.txt, include/brlcad_ident.h.in,
	  src/libbu/dir.c:
	  Start looking at what's involved with folding the necessary
	  pieces of bu_brlcad_root into bu_dir.

	* [r74397] doc/docbook/articles/nirt.xml,
	  doc/docbook/system/mann/debug.xml:
	  Make the point more strongly that debug settings are not for
	  general user consumption.

2019-11-30 16:01  starseeker

	* [r74396] src/nirt/main.cpp:
	  Tweak -X option for new debug cmd

2019-11-30 15:48  starseeker

	* [r74395] src/libanalyze/nirt.cpp:
	  fix help string for autogenerated version of debug cmd

2019-11-30 15:47  starseeker

	* [r74394] src/libanalyze/CMakeLists.txt, src/libanalyze/nirt.cpp:
	  Make the libanalyze version of NIRT's debugging command work
	  using the same mechanism as the new libged debug command. Only
	  difference is nirt's doesn't expose liboptical debugging, and
	  does expose libanalyze debugging (the latter should probably be
	  turned on in libged as well, but libanalyze doesn't link in
	  liboptical so we need to avoid it here.)

	* [r74391] misc/tools/debug2c/debug2c.cxx, src/libged/debug.c:
	  Fully encapsulate the debug command logic into the generated
	  output of debug2c

2019-11-30 13:43  starseeker

	* [r74390] src/libged/debug.c:
	  Encapsulate the debug cmd eval flow into a non-ged specific
	  function as a preliminary to making the whole thing part of the
	  debug2c output.

2019-11-30 03:51  starseeker

	* [r74389] doc/docbook/system/mann/debug.xml:
	  spelling

2019-11-29 15:24  starseeker

	* [r74388] CHANGES:
	  Start the clock ticking on getting rid of the --old option for
	  nirt - not urgent, but we need to do it at some point for
	  cleanup/code simplification.
