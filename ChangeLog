	* [r44318] NEWS, include/conf/PATCH:
	  beginning final release steps for 7.18.4, bump patch

2011-04-12 06:17  brlcad

	* [r44314] src/libged/red.c:
	  one sec is probably plenty

2011-04-12 06:10  brlcad

	* [r44313] TODO:
	  red no longer show-stopper, but still needs to be fixed.

2011-04-12 06:09  brlcad

	* [r44312] src/libged/red.c:
	  blather a strong warning since several data-destructive bugs are
	  now confirmed, but not enough time to fix before release.
	  hopefully better to warn than disable since some use cases are
	  fine.

2011-04-12 05:57  brlcad

	* [r44311] src/libged/red.c:
	  add a -f force flag to forcibly overwrite a pre-existing comb if
	  the new name would result in an existing object getting
	  overwritten. also fixed a memory free crash bug if final_name is
	  NULL.

2011-04-12 05:51  brlcad

	* [r44310] regress/Makefile.am:
	  add a 'red' rule to run the new red regression test, but don't
	  add it to the release regression due to all of the bugs

2011-04-12 05:51  brlcad

	* [r44309] regress/red.sh:
	  add an extensive test of the mged 'red' command due to repeat
	  failures. regression unveils at least 11 other bugs, quality, and
	  robustness issues still remaining.

2011-04-11 09:24  jordisayol

	* [r44293] sh/make_deb.sh, sh/make_rpm.sh:
	  Properly handle errors during GNU/Linux packages building.

2011-04-08 20:03  erikgreenwald

	* [r44288] db/bldg391.asc:
	  remove references to nonexistent regions (midwall.r equip)

2011-04-08 19:35  erikgreenwald

	* [r44286] src/libged/search.c:
	  some notes on the workaround for the "search ." bug

2011-04-08 19:31  erikgreenwald

	* [r44284] sh/conversion.sh:
	  force posix output from time(1)

2011-04-08 19:09  erikgreenwald

	* [r44283] sh/conversion.sh:
	  If no OBJECTS are set, pass an explicit "-print" to search. This
	  may be a bug in the ged_search implementation ("search ." is no
	  longer legitimate).

2011-04-08 15:14  r_weiss

	* [r44280] include/raytrace.h:
	  Updated the header file 'raytrace.h' to include the definition of
	  a new prototype function 'nmg_dump_model'. This new function is
	  located in file 'nmg_tri.c'. This update supports the new
	  prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate
	  faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added to disable this change
	  by default. This code is a work in progress.

2011-04-08 15:06  r_weiss

	* [r44279] include/bn.h:
	  Updated the header file for libbn (i.e. bn.h) to include the
	  definition of new prototype versions of the functions
	  'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3' located in the
	  file 'plane.c'. The names of these new function are
	  'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3_new'. These
	  functions support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  (nmg triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added to
	  disable these changes by default. This code is a work in
	  progress.

2011-04-08 15:00  r_weiss

	* [r44278] src/libbn/plane.c:
	  Added new prototype versions of the functions
	  'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3' to the file
	  'plane.c'. The names of these new function are
	  'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3_new'. These
	  functions support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  (nmg triangulate faceuse). At some point the new and original
	  version of these functions will be consolidated. Preprocessor
	  commands were added so these new function are disabled by
	  default. This code is a work in progress.

2011-04-08 03:37  brlcad

	* [r44277] src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	  revert r44259

2011-04-07 21:34  r_weiss

	* [r44269] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_inter.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_isect_eu_fu' within file 'nmg_inter.c'.
	  This update supports the new prototype function
	  'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by
	  default since it is untested in the production code. This update
	  changes a floating point compare against 0.0 to -SMALL_FASTF
	  which should produce a more reliable result. This update is a
	  work in progress.

2011-04-07 21:23  r_weiss

	* [r44268] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_mod.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_lu_reorient' within file 'nmg_mod.c'. This
	  update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is
	  untested in the production code. This update changes a floating
	  point compare against 0.0 to -SMALL_FASTF which should produce a
	  more reliable result. This update is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 21:05  r_weiss

	* [r44267] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_info.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_2edgeuse_g_coincident' within file
	  'nmg_info.c'. This update supports the new prototype function
	  'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by
	  default since it is untested in the production code. The original
	  code appears to contain a bug where it assumes 'edge geometries
	  are everywhere coincident' when all previous checks are
	  inconclusive. This update is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 20:38  r_weiss

	* [r44266] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_class.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_classify_lu_lu' within file 'nmg_class.c'.
	  This update supports the new prototype function
	  'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by
	  default since it is untested in the production code. The update
	  changes a floating point compare against 0.0 to -SMALL_FASTF
	  which should produce a more reliable result. This update is a
	  work in progress.

2011-04-07 20:13  r_weiss

	* [r44265] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_mod.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_cut_loop' within file 'nmg_mod.c'. This
	  update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is
	  untested in the production code. This code was updated since the
	  2nd parameter passed into 'nmg_split_lu_at_vu' is added to the
	  new loopuse created by 'nmg_split_lu_at_vu'. Because of this, the
	  2nd parameter should be vu2 because when 'nmg_cut_loop' is called
	  and returns, it is expected that vu1 remain within the same
	  loopuse as when 'nmg_cut_loop' was called. This change corrected
	  a problem within the function 'cut_unimonotone' within the while
	  (verts > 3) loop where after a cut when the to/from vertex is the
	  same, the 'nmg_cut_loop' would return with the 1st parameter
	  (vu1) returning being associated with the new loopuse (i.e. with
	  3 vertices) instead of the old loopuse which we need to finish
	  cutting. The while (verts > 3) loop moves to the next cut based
	  on the loopuse associated with the 1st parameter (vu1) so when
	  the loopuse of vu1 changes the logic breaks in the while (verts >
	  3) loop. This update is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 19:39  r_weiss

	* [r44264] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Updated function 'is_convex' within file 'nmg_tri.c'. This update
	  supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg
	  triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is
	  untested in the production code. This code was updated since
	  during loopuse triangulation, sometimes it is necessary to allow
	  degenerate triangles (i.e. zero area). Because of this, we need
	  to allow the definition of convex to include 0 and 180 degree
	  angles. The original code here contains a bug since the units of
	  'angle' is radians but the units of 'tol->perp' is not. Since
	  changing any tolerances related to nmg triangulation seem to have
	  both negative and positive impacts, I decided not to arbitrarily
	  correct this bug. This update is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 19:12  r_weiss

	* [r44263] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Updated function 'pick_pt2d_for_cutjoin' within file 'nmg_tri.c'.
	  This update supports the new prototype function
	  'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by
	  default since it is untested in the production code. The purpose
	  of the 'pick_pt2d_for_cutjoin' function is to select which
	  vertexuse will be used when performing a cut/join between two
	  loopuse within a faceuse. This update was made since if the
	  'from' and 'to' cut vertexuse are in the same loopuse, it should
	  be safe to assume the current pt2d records for these vertexuse
	  are correct for the cut. Therefore, do not search for other pt2d
	  vertexuse records, just exit this function using the vertexuse
	  pt2d records passed into this function. If we allow this function
	  to continue and search for alternate vertexuse, sometimes,
	  depending on the number of vertexuse at the cut points, and the
	  complexity of the angles between the edges at the cuts, an
	  incorrect vertexuse is often chosen. This change avoids the error
	  prone logic when we can assume the vertexuse passed into this
	  function are the correct vertexuse for the cut, i.e. when the two
	  vertexuse are in the same loopuse. This update is a work in
	  progress.

2011-04-07 18:42  r_weiss

	* [r44262] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Added a new prototype version of the function 'cut_unimonotone'
	  to the file 'nmg_tri.c'. This function supports the new prototype
	  function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). This
	  function performs a triangulation of a outer loop (OT_SAME
	  loopuse) by using ear clipping. This function will be renamed
	  later since it is not triangulating/cutting a unimonotone
	  polygon. Preprocessor commands were added so this new function is
	  disabled by default. This code is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 18:14  r_weiss

	* [r44261] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Added the functions 'nmg_plot_fu', 'nmg_triangulate_rm_holes',
	  'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse', and 'nmg_dump_model' to the
	  file 'nmg_tri.c'. These are prototype functions that support the
	  new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate
	  faceuse). The function 'nmg_plot_fu' creates a plot file for each
	  loopuse in a faceuse and color codes each edgeuse. The function
	  'nmg_triangulate_rm_holes' removes holes (OT_OPPOSITE loopuse) in
	  a faceuse by joining them with outer loops (OT_SAME loopuse). The
	  function 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse' removes degenerate
	  (i.e. < 3 vertices) loopuse from a faceuse. The function
	  'nmg_dump_model' write all the vertex coordinates in an nmg model
	  to a log file. Preprocessor commands were added so these new
	  functions are disabled by default. This code is a work in
	  progress.

2011-04-07 17:33  r_weiss

	* [r44260] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Added a prototype version of the function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  (nmg triangulate faceuse) to the file 'nmg_tri.c'. Added
	  preprocessor commands to, by default, disable the new function
	  and retain the original version. This code is a work in progress.

2011-04-07 16:54  brlcad

	* [r44259] src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	  is the common.h header necessary here? builds clean without

2011-04-07 16:26  r_weiss

	* [r44257] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Added preprocessor commands to optionally disable nmg
	  triangulation functions within nmg_tri.c that are not needed when
	  new 'prototype' nmg triangulation code is enabled. The functions
	  to be disabled are print_2d_eu, print_trap, print_tlist, vtype2d,
	  poly_start_vertex, poly_side_vertex, poly_end_vertex,
	  hole_start_vertex, hole_end_vertex, nmg_trap_face, skip_cut,
	  cut_diagonals, cut_unimonotone, nmg_plot_flat_face. By default,
	  existing code will not be disabled and new prototype code will
	  not be enabled.

	* [r44246] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  use the new __BU_ATTR_ALWAYS_INLINE define so that we get forced
	  inline behavior for newer gcc or forced off if older. the
	  'inline' keyword may be superfluous or even problematic, but
	  keeping for now given it's the original intent.

2011-04-07 01:17  brlcad

	* [r44245] include/bu.h, include/common.h:
	  add __BU_ATTR_ALWAYS_INLINE with a protection for gcc 3.4 and
	  earlier where the always_inline attribute wasn't yet fully
	  implemented (reportedly still works for some optimization
	  options)

2011-04-06 18:13  erikgreenwald

	* [r44241] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  remove inline calls that cause gcc3.4.6 to fail (needs review)

	* [r44239] src/librt/primitives/bot/g_bot_include.c:
	  Having issues with 'size_t' declaration of some variables within
	  function rt_bot_makesegs_(). Variables need signed values so
	  converted to 'ssize_t'. Only looked at this function due to a bug
	  report but may need to look over all 'size_t' changes.

2011-04-06 15:02  bob1961

	* [r44237] src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	  Added a wrapper for the call to dbupgrade from the Tools menu.
	  This catches the call and prints the results to the command
	  window. The catch prevents a possible error window popping up.

	* [r44225] NEWS:
	  bob found/fixed a bug with the title command. presumably, this
	  would convert the working units to mm if you tried to set the
	  title via the units command. looks like the bug is very old
	  dating back to July 2000, r18822, when a db_v4_get_units_code()
	  snippet was converted to a db_update_ident() parameter.

	  I get it. It was an April Fool's Joke, right?? Revert to r44152
	  since it makes all sorts of calls to LIBDM macros and the dm
	  struct, requires libdm header. Mostly because this is right in
	  the middle of source tarball preparations, even if it's a
	  work-in-progress, to be sorted out after the sources are tagged
	  for release. otherwise, release testing would have to start all
	  over again. Design-wise, LIBGED shouldn't be
	  calling/using/touching LIBDM (or LIBFB), shouldn't be using
	  'objects' as in the ged_obj from libtclcad or various 'go_'
	  routines, nor adding to ged public API that doesn't fit the

	  willing to put forth time/effort to do anything more than print
	  the error since would have to evaluate each call on a case by

	* [r43541] src/mged/points/points_scan.l, src/tab/script.l:
	  quell flex lameness where fwrite() is being called without
	  checking the return value. this quiets the compiler.

2011-03-01 04:44  brlcad

	* [r43540] src/mged/points/points_parse.y:
	  bison is being stupid with some output code generating size_t

	  other preprocessor symbols that are not defined but being used in
	  expressions.

2011-03-01 04:39  brlcad

	* [r43539] src/proc-db/brepintersect.cpp:
	  compiler is complaining about the first param to

	* [r43527] src/librt/Makefile.am, src/librt/search.c,

	  Add work done so far on search move to librt - not being added to
	  the compile until after the release.

2011-02-28 23:13  starseeker

	* [r43526] include/raytrace.h:

2011-02-28 23:02  brlcad

	* [r43525] src/conv/Makefile.am:
	  missing the shapefil.h header

2011-02-28 21:54  brlcad

2011-02-28 21:35  brlcad

	* [r43522] src/tab/script.l:
	  overcome flex stupidities, define undefined to false in order to
	  appease preprocessor logic.

2011-02-28 21:21  brlcad

	* [r43521] src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  no longer need the __BSD_VISIBLE/__USE_XOPEN/__USE_BSD hacking to
	  get the extension decls with configure using gnu99.

2011-02-28 21:10  brlcad

	* [r43520] src/util/dunncomm.c:
	  wrong comment

2011-02-28 20:55  brlcad

	* [r43519] configure.ac:
	  there's no reason to leave out the gnu extensions other than to
	  try and avoid non-standard functions. in practice, however, c99
	  compliance means we also don't get the posix functions, which is
	  somewhat problematic. change the compliance from std99 to gnu99.

2011-02-28 20:52  brlcad

	* [r43518] src/mged/attach.c:

	* [r43515] include/bin.h:
	  need sys/types.h for netinet/tcp.h

2011-02-28 18:41  brlcad

	* [r43513] src/conv/stl/stl-g.c:
	  nope, missed one

	* [r43511] src/conv/asc/asc2g.c, src/conv/asc/g2asc.c,
	  src/conv/poly-bot.c, src/conv/stl/g-stl.c:
	  and maybe the last batch of bin.h inclusions needed.

	  promulgation continues, switch from bio.h to bin.h where
	  byteorder functions are being used.

2011-02-28 18:34  brlcad

	* [r43509] src/libged/bot_dump.c:
	  need networking and i/o functions here, so also include bin.h

2011-02-28 18:29  brlcad

	* [r43508] src/librt/db_scan.c:
	  ditto, bio.h -> bin.h for networking

2011-02-28 18:28  brlcad

	* [r43507] src/librt/db5_io.c:
	  need bin.h instead of bio.h

2011-02-28 18:22  brlcad

	* [r43506] include/bio.h:
	  remove inclusion of arpa/inet.h from bio.h since it's not
	  desirable to bundle networking routines in with the input/output
	  routines. this is in part due to the implied dependency on the
	  windows socket library on the windows platform, which isn't
	  necessarily true for inclusions only needing standard i/o. the
	  new bin.h internet networking header now covers networking.

2011-02-28 18:20  brlcad

	* [r43505] src/librt/primitives/pnts/pnts.c:
	  include bin.h instead of bio.h for htonl and friends

2011-02-28 18:16  brlcad

	* [r43504] src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	  include headers for htonl

2011-02-28 18:14  brlcad

	* [r43503] src/librt/Makefile.am:
	  missing the tieprivate.h header

2011-02-28 18:11  brlcad

	* [r43502] include/Makefile.am, include/bin.h:
	  add an initial corrollary header file similar to bio.h but for
	  internet networking instead of input/output. it's similarly a
	  'private' self-contained header (so no HAVE_* defines), but
	  should help consolidate the header preprocessor logic into one
	  place. this header is effectively treated as a system header
	  coming before inclusions of brl-cad public/private headers.

2011-02-28 17:18  jordisayol

	* [r43501] misc/debian/changelog:
	  update debian changelog

2011-02-28 17:04  brlcad

	* [r43500] src/libged/CMakeLists.txt:
	  add fb2pix.c and pix2fb.c

2011-02-28 16:36  brlcad

	* [r43499] TODO:
	  release tasks were not completed by the end of the month, so push
	  to the next iteration. only remaining task that comes to mind is
	  removing the network dep from bio.h (need a separate header since
	  it's just for standard i/o)

2011-02-28 16:04  d_rossberg

	* [r43497] src/conv/CMakeLists.txt, src/conv/stl/stl-g.c,
	  src/librt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  ntohl(): missing includes and libraries for the MSVC CMake build
	  (needs WinSock 2)

	* [r43496] src/canon/canonize.c, src/librtserver/rtserver.c,

	  Various quellage

2011-02-28 06:10  brlcad

	* [r43488] include/vmath.h, src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.cpp:
	  minimally impacting API change, rename V2APPROXEQUAL to
	  V2NEAR_EQUAL so the api is more self-consistent.

2011-02-28 06:05  brlcad

	* [r43487] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  minimally impacting change, renaming V2APPROXEQUAL() to

2011-02-28 06:04  brlcad

	* [r43486] src/librt/primitives/bspline/bspline.cpp:
	  convert from xdr to standard byteorder functions casting
	  accordingly.

2011-02-28 05:55  brlcad

	* [r43485] include/bu.h, src/librt/db5_io.c:
	  formally deprecate the old eXternal Data Representation (XDR)
	  functions via API markers. all of the bu_p(long|short|etc) and
	  bu_g(long|short|etc) functions have comparable byteorder
	  functions provided standard via posix.1 as hton(l|s) and
	  ntoh(l|s). the one exception is support for converting 64-bit
	  long long types, so use the recently added configure.ac tests and
	  define htonll() and ntohll() respectively as macros supporting
	  big and little endian platforms.

2011-02-28 05:51  brlcad

	* [r43484] include/raytrace.h:
	  now that all usages should be weeded out, formally deprecate
	  rt_fdiff() and rt_reldiff() in the header. not 100% equivalent,
	  so use with caution, but recommend most conversions change to
	  NEAR_EQUAL(a,b,0.001) and EQUAL(a,b) respectively.

2011-02-28 05:49  brlcad

	* [r43483] src/libged/bot_dump.c:
	  convert from xdr bu_plong() to byteorder htonl()

2011-02-28 05:31  brlcad

	* [r43482] src/gtools/g_transfer.c, src/remrt/rtsrv.c:
	  since ext_buf buffers are now uint8_t*'s we need to cast them to
	  char*'s for libpkg (until libpkg is upgraded).

2011-02-28 05:23  brlcad

	* [r43481] src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	  more xdr to posix.1 byteorder function conversions, bu_plong to
	  htonl

2011-02-28 05:20  brlcad

	* [r43480] src/rt/viewray.c:
	  call NEAR_EQUAL() instead of rt_fdiff()

2011-02-28 05:10  brlcad

	* [r43479] src/conv/asc/asc2g.c, src/conv/asc/g2asc.c,
	  src/conv/poly-bot.c, src/conv/stl/g-stl.c, src/conv/stl/stl-g.c:
	  convert converters using the libbu xdr routines to using the
	  posix.1 byteorder functions, using hton*/ntoh*

2011-02-28 04:50  brlcad

	* [r43478] src/libfb/if_remote.c:
	  convert libfb's remote framebuffer from using libbu's xdr
	  routines to using the posix.1 byteorder functions, using
	  hton*/ntoh*

2011-02-24 23:37  r_weiss

	* [r43454] src/libbn/bntester.c:
	  Updates to bntester.c for testing functions bn_isect_line3_line3
	  and bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3.

2011-02-24 19:28  erikgreenwald

	* [r43452] misc/win32-msvc8/librt/librt.vcproj:
	  Add winsock library for htonl/ntohl/etc. Add tie/btg files.

2011-02-24 19:23  erikgreenwald

	* [r43451] misc/win32-msvc8/Makefile.am:
	  automake should probably know that libtie.vcproj isn't around,
	  too...

2011-02-24 19:18  erikgreenwald

	* [r43450] misc/win32-msvc8/brlcad/brlcad.sln,
	  misc/win32-msvc8/libtie:
	  libtie no longer exists, it's now part of librt

2011-02-24 19:11  erikgreenwald

	* [r43449] misc/win32-msvc8/libged/libged.vcproj:
	  add fb2pix.c, pix2fb.c and libfb.lib

2011-02-24 19:03  erikgreenwald

	* [r43448] include/bio.h:
	  winsock.h gets included via the windows.h megaheader, don't need
	  to explicitly #include

2011-02-24 14:56  erikgreenwald

	* [r43447] include/bio.h, src/librt/primitives/pnts/pnts.c:
	  include headers for hton[ls]/ntoh[ls] family

2011-02-24 14:35  bob1961

	* [r43446] src/tclscripts/lib/TkTable.tcl:
	  Added cadwidgets::TkTable::handleEnter and -entercommand

2011-02-24 06:26  brlcad

	* [r43445] include/rtfunc.h:
	  a callback for requesting an objects 'class' was never
	  implemented. formally mark deprecation in header with compiler
	  hints so warnings are issued on used.

2011-02-24 06:25  brlcad

	* [r43444] include/db.h:
	  formally deprecate the flip functions as API: rt_fastf_float(),
	  rt_mat_dbmat(), and rt_dbmat_mat().

2011-02-24 06:20  brlcad

	* [r43443] src/librt/primitives/tor/tor.c:
	  torus also needs the private header and makes a call to the
	  deprecated rt_fdiff() function. this becomes a simple loose
	  tolerance comparison for equality.

2011-02-24 06:19  brlcad

	* [r43442] src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c:
	  need librt_private.h for private flip func, also change call from
	  rt_reldiff() to a NEAR_EQUAL() due to deprecation. benchmark
	  validation required but the use here seems to be a fairly safe
	  since we're considerably tightening the test whether the vectors
	  reduces the ellipse equation down to quadratic form. might affect
	  worst case performance but should provide the same results.

2011-02-24 06:02  brlcad

	* [r43441] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch.c:
	  update the last of the xdr to posix.1 byteorder function
	  conversions. increment using our SIZEOF constants instead of
	  hard-coding sizes too.

2011-02-24 05:53  brlcad

	* [r43440] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg.c:
	  by far the most complex to date, deprecation conversion away from
	  using xdr routines to using posix.1 ntohl/htonl and friends. take
	  care to increment as char pointers and not long pointers. nmg
	  apparently requires a LOT of conversions...

2011-02-24 05:02  brlcad

	* [r43439] src/librt/primitives/bot/bot.c:
	  big deprecation conversion from xdr routines to posix.1 byteorder
	  functions. taking the address of element zero isn't strictly
	  necessary but does make the code more self-consistent given the
	  slew of face and normal arrays that do require element indexing.

2011-02-24 04:59  brlcad

	* [r43438] src/librt/primitives/metaball/metaball.c:
	  more conversion from xdr routines to ntohl()/htonl() being
	  careful to increment the buffer as char pointers, not as uint32_t
	  pointers.

2011-02-24 04:56  brlcad

	* [r43437] src/librt/primitives/ars/ars.c:
	  more conversion from xdr routines to ntohl()/htonl()

2011-02-24 04:55  brlcad

	* [r43436] src/librt/primitives/dsp/dsp.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/pipe/pipe.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/pnts/pnts.c:
	  more conversion from xdr routines to ntohl()/htonl()

2011-02-24 04:53  brlcad

	* [r43435] src/librt/primitives/arbn/arbn.c:
	  convert from bu xdr routines to ntohl()/htonl()

2011-02-24 04:50  brlcad

	* [r43434] src/librt/primitives/extrude/extrude.c:
	  convert from bu xdr routines to ntohl()/htonl()

2011-02-24 04:43  brlcad

	* [r43433] src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c,

	  src/librt/primitives/superell/superell.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/tgc/tgc.c, src/librt/primitives/tor/tor.c:
	  call flip_fastf_float() instead of rt_fastf_float() so we can
	  deprecate the old rt api routine. include private header as
	  needed.

2011-02-24 04:39  brlcad

	* [r43432] src/librt/db_scan.c:
	  progressive conversion of libbu xdr routines over to posix.1
	  byteorder functions. simple conversion when getting (net -> host)
	  values.

2011-02-24 04:34  brlcad

	* [r43431] src/librt/vlist.c:
	  progressive conversion of libbu xdr routines over to posix.1
	  byteorder functions. note an abuse of vls in here, being used as
	  a byte buffer.

2011-02-23 20:39  brlcad

	* [r43429] include/bu.h, src/conv/poly-bot.c,
	  src/librt/constraint.c, src/librt/db5_io.c, src/librt/db5_scan.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp,

	  src/librt/primitives/submodel/submodel.c,
	  src/librt/primitives/vol/vol.c:
	  convert the bu_external byte buffer from being a genptr_t (i.e.,
	  void*) array to being a uint8_t* array. this fixes some coercion
	  problems attempting to pass data through a void pointer and, more
	  importantly, better reflects the intent of the container.

2011-02-23 17:17  brlcad

	* [r43428] src/librt/binunif/db5_bin.c:
	  typo, supposed to be a pointer. odd.

2011-02-23 14:25  brlcad

	* [r43427] src/librt/binunif/db5_bin.c:
	  this might have worked, but it was a bad way. don't work with
	  truncated values, cast the char array to the corresponding type
	  being read/written

2011-02-23 05:00  brlcad

	* [r43426] include/bu.h:
	  not true, they expect pointers

2011-02-22 17:13  brlcad

	* [r43425] configure.ac:

	  to visualize Baltimore City data made available to the public.
	  the converter takes the shapefile input (using shapelib) and
	  imports the data as sketch/extrude geomettry. sketches working
	  great, extrudes need some debugging love.
