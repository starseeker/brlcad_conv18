bl_main_power_line.r or bl_bl.s2. bn_mat_inv() singular matrix error.  bug 
found and reported by mcarp, thanks

	* include/bu.h, include/bn.h:
	have the headers include the headers they respectively require

2006-09-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am:
	make the dependency on libbu.la more explicit, otherwise some versions 
of automake/libtool seem to not detect the dependency causing them to attempt a 
linking of htester before libbu has finished building.  thx to dan o'neill for 
reporting this issue (sf bug report 1563466, libbu.la missing)

2006-09-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	To help Doxygen, distinguish the libbu/cmd.c from the cmd.c in other 
directories

	* src/tclscripts/mged/facetize_all_regions.tcl:
	Routines to facetize all regions in a database.  For use in conjunction 
with the "facetall.sh" script

	* sh/facetall.sh:
	Driver script for facetizing all regions in a database.  Since mged may
	abort during some failed facetization attempts, we need a shell script 
so that we can re-start it and continue facetizing.

	* doc/html/manuals/mged/mged_cmd_index.html:
	making the example code consistent.  Region id's indicated I didn't 
type the
	example in all at once.  Sigh.  Now it looks like I did.

	* doc/html/manuals/mged/mged_cmd_index.html: fixed typos

	* src/tclscripts/mged/Makefile.am, 
src/tclscripts/mged/expand_comb_tree.tcl:

mention that BRL-CAD is in the FreeBSD ports system.

	* doc/README.AIX:
	add initial details about how much of a pain it is to compiled with the 
IBM Visual Age compiler on AIX, but that it is possible.

	* doc/Makefile.am: add README.VAX

	* doc/README.VAX:
	add an initial README for VAX given a compile does seem to still be 
possible via simh.  provide the details on what has to be done.

2006-09-18  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/archer: file name is just archer, not archer.sh

	* README: case consistency

	* sh/footer.sh, sh/header.sh:
	automatically detect a slew of script types by looking at the first 
line of the file -- if the /bin/* is recognizable, then the file doesn't need a 
suffix after all.

	* include/Makefile.am: forms.h was removed, apparently unused

2006-09-15  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-nmg.c:
	copy the color table from input to output, so colors render properly in 
converted file

	* src/librt/nmg_misc.c:
	calloc needed to provide initialization of unused/unset bot parameters 
(i.e. normals)

2006-09-15  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am:
	enable compilation of htester, not installed though

	* src/libbn/Makefile.am, src/libbn/htester.c, src/libbu/Makefile.am, 
src/libbu/htester.c:
	do as the comment suggests and move the htester.c test application that 
exercises the host to network floating point functions from libbn to libbu

2006-09-12  mjgillich  <mjgillich@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-xxx.c: Modified g-xxx.c to db_walk_tree verses db_fun_tree

2006-09-12  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	linking against a system tkstub library may require linking against the 
tclstub library as well, at least that seems to be the case on mac os x's 
default-provided static tkstub archive

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	er, reverse that order.  if we're building tcl, then we have tcl_nil -- 
otherwise link against TCL

	* configure.ac:
	so we apparently can't actually call any opengl function (at least on 
macosx) without a valid context or it will cause a bus error, so instead just 
link against some useful symbols.

include/vmath.h, include/wdb.h, include/bn.h, include/bu.h, 
include/libtermio.h, include/machine.h, include/nmg.h, include/noalias-prag.h, 
include/noalias.h, include/optical.h, include/plastic.h, include/plot3.h, 
include/raytrace.h:
	miscelaneous changes to support doxygen

	* src/librt/memalloc.c:
	annotate malloc entries so that we know where the allocation took place

	* misc/Doxyfile, misc/doxygen_structure:
	New doxygen configuration file Doxyfile.  The doxygen_structure file 
defines
	the layout of the heirarchy of the doxygen document

2006-08-30  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/jove/jove.h, src/other/jove/jove_main.c, 
src/other/jove/jove_term.c:
	obliterate SYSV/SYS5 usage, instead relying on HAVE_ symbols more 
consistently (hopefully).

	* configure.ac, src/mged/Makefile.am:
	check for the solaris lexer library (needed for yyless() apparently) 
and provide LIBL accordingly for Makefile.am usage.

2006-08-29  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO, src/util/op-bw.c:
	op-bw had a long run but seeing as it is vax-specific, it is being 
marked obsolete.  the sources are marked for removal at the next minor update 
(probably by 7.10).

	* src/proc-db/pix2g.c:
	stupid sync().. who wrote this? .. changed to db_sync()

	* src/mged/dm_old/dm-mer.c: no protection for you

	* src/mged/cmd.c: sync via db_sync instead of fsync'ing directly.

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	sync via db_sync in db_close instead of manually duplicating what is 
conceptually db_sync's job

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	rework db_sync() so that it always flushs and tries fsync() if 
available and only sync() as last resort.

	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	remove the sync() call.  instead just fsync() the currently open 
geometry database file.  doxygenify the comments while we're in here.

	* configure.ac:
	check for fsync(), bsd func that some older systems don't have

	* src/librt/db_open.c: fsync the file before closing it just to be safe

	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	no need to forward declare it if we just move the definition up

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c: forgot to enclose macro params in parens

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	get rid of the _WIN32 sections for recv/send instead of read/write .. 
this really shouldn't be necessary if the compatibility macros in the 
config_win.h header are specified correctly, but for now keep it as it is just 
without all the repetition by using macros that call the corresponding routine. 
 oh yeah, and M-x indent-region ws too.

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c: minor, consolidate return

2006-08-29  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/ged.c:
	Mods to get things to natively compile on Windows.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Added method to purge edit history. More mods to accomodate ogl being 
replaced by wgl.

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	It looks like the intent was to struct copy a "struct in_addr" in the 
_pkg_permserver_impl function.

2006-08-29  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c, src/mged/sedit.h:
	Added "method" to metaball struct. Begin stubbing out ECMD stuff. 
Changed some language.

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c, src/mged/typein.c:
	Added "method" to metaball struct. Changed some language.

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c: fix a crash in the exporter...

	* include/rtgeom.h, src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Added "method" to metaball struct. Changed some language.

2006-08-29  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/librt.dsp: added transform.c

	* src/libbu/libbu.dsp: added bu_fgets.c

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/TclDummies.c: Tcl_SetErrno dummy function

2006-08-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	initial functional stubbings for a 'brlcad' library.  use the newly 
added libbu/libbn/librt/libwdb convenience libraries, mimicking what is already 
done for the windows dll.  don't enable the actual installable object yet until 
the next minor release.

2006-08-28  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	Changed the JNI wrapper names to agree with the new class names in the 
MUVES3 brlcadservice

2006-08-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am:
	make a convenience library for libwdb so that it may be bundled into 
other libraries

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	there may not exist a libtcl_nil.la if building tcl was disabled to act 
accordingly

	* include/bu.h: added new bu_get_hash_key() decl

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am, src/other/libtcl/Makefile.am:
	make/use noinst convenience library for libtcl just like was done for 
bu, bn, rt so that librtserver can have no dependencies other than guaranteed 
system ones

	* misc/win32-msvc/brlcad.dsw:
	on second thought, remove libtclcad.. it really doesn't 'fit' well with 
the rest without including all of brl-cad's libs

2006-08-28  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/hash.c: Added bu_get_hash_key()

2006-08-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	use the new convenience libraries for libbu, libbn, librt instead of 
using the usual lib_LTLIBRARY so that we don't end up creating a jnilib that 
has rpath run-time requirements looking up librt, libbn, and libbu.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am, src/libbn/Makefile.am, src/libbu/Makefile.am:
	create convenience libraries for libbu, libbn, and librt so that they 
may be used in other libraries to fully resolve symbols (by virtue of full 
inclusion).

	* src/libbu/printb.c, src/mged/cmd.c: ws

	* src/libbu/malloc.c:
	even if we're in debug mode, don't abort the requested task (i.e. 
free'ing memory) else invoke the wrath of corrupted leaky memory

	* BUGS:
	the debugbu 2 bug occurs because bu_memdebug_add() is not called unless 
memory checking is enabled via bu_debug.  so when bu_debug is set to 2 or 3, it 
ends up reporting errors during bu_free() for items that were allocated and 
were not yet being tracked.

	* src/fbserv/server.c, src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c, src/mged/fbserv.c, 
src/mged/vrlink.c:
	quell libpkg warnings now that there are more comprehensive 
declarations.

	* src/remrt/remrt.c:
	quell warnings on the errlog callback by defining a remrt_log() that 
passes through to bu_log().

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	consistently use char * buffers (instead of unsigned) and be more 
specific on the errlog callbacks

	* include/pkg.h:
	add PKG_EXTERN and PKG_ARGS wrappers like the other libs, consistently 
make all the buffers char *

2006-08-26  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* INSTALL:
	more detailed testing section, with details on testing functionality 
before and after installation.  also, make the quick instructions be an 
optimized build.  give examples on how to provide custom flags during configure 
and make too.

2006-08-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pad_file.xml.in:
	more than a million lines, squeeze in to 2000 chars

	* README: line counts are more than a million now

	* doc/description.txt:
	add a history section, credit mike of course.  cover a little more 
detail on the languages in use.  line count is over a million now.

	* sh/tracker.sh: decode the title before printing it to console too

2006-08-25  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	Somewhere along the line "smooth_bot" command got changed to
	"bot_smooth", but the help never got changed. The help now agrees with
	the command.

2006-08-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/if_remote.c:
	quell prototype warnings by making the errlog callback function match 
the signature via a simple passthrough to a rem_log().

	* src/libdm/dm-X.c, src/libdm/dm-glx.c, src/libdm/dm-ogl.c, 
src/libdm/dm-pex.c, src/libdm/dm-tk.c, src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	according to one of the tcl devs (thx jenglish), Tk_IsMapped() is not 
what we should be using to determine if the tkwin is 'valid' .. being 'mapped' 
apparently means that there is a window that has been explicitly mapped via a 
Tk_MapWindow() call or is otherwise fully drawn/displayed.  fall back to a 
simple non-null check instead.

2006-08-24  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	added return from pkg_permserver_ip (oops); made strings const for 
pkg_open - since they should be...

	* include/pkg.h: added function prototypes, C linkage wrapper

2006-08-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS, src/mged/attach.c:
	prevent infinite loop on classic mged attach prompt.  check whether 
fgets is stuck on EOF so we can cancel the prompt.

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	simple infinite loop protection on the attach prompt (it can go into an 
inf loop on unexpected input (e.g. ctrl-d)).  also protect against dereference 
crashes when there is no display.

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	prevent dereference crash if there is an uninitialized display

	* NEWS, src/mged/ged.c:
	ctrl-d on an empty shell line now quits mged like one might expect for 
an interactive console shell.  this addresses sf bug report 1543495.

	* src/librt/db_comb.c, src/librt/tcl.c, include/raytrace.h:
	Consistently use integers instead of shorts for the region id, air 
code, GIFT material code, and los value for the rt_comb_internal structure.  
region ids are already handled almost entirely as integers throughout the code, 
but the usage of shorts in the comb structure seems to be a carry-over from 
prior v4 format support that was never changed.  a review of code seems to 
indicate that the only negative impact should only be rather unsupported 
behavior if someone actually reverts a v5 db to v4 that has region idents that 
overflow short.  (this mod is in support of JTCG/ME and addresses sf bug 
1532661 "Mismatch In Size of region_id" reported by Tom Browder)

2006-08-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/.cvsignore:
	ignore the auto-generated files so they aren't accidentally committed 
to cvs

	* src/libdm/dm-pex.c:
	missed pex interface, use xtkwin insted of dpy with Tk_IsMapped()

2006-08-23  lbutler  <lbutler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/malloc.c:
	bu_prmem() was printing the number of available slots in the memory 
debug
	table.  This was easily mis-interpreted as the number of memory 
allocations.
	Since this is a diagnostic for how the memory debug table is being 
manipulated
	and not something the average user/programmer wants to see, the value
	was removed from bu_prmem()'s output.  Minor benefit:  The table now 
prints
	one less line, so output is more compact.

2006-08-22  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	john fixed the tree command so that it now matches the documentation, 
by adding support for -i and -o.  this fixes sf bug 1480522 'Tree cmd not 
accepting args' as reported by david lowman.

	* src/libdm/dm-X.c, src/libdm/dm-glx.c, src/libdm/dm-ogl.c, 
src/libdm/dm-tk.c, src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	Tk_IsMapped takes a tkwin, not a Display, so give it what it wants for 
the sanity check.  add another for the mainwindow too even.

	* src/libdm/query.c: oops, declare dpy as a Display

	* NEWS: added archer geometry/view loading via command-line arg

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	libtclcad depends on libfb for tkImgFmtPIX fb_() image sizing functions

2006-08-22  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc7/librt/librt.vcproj: Added g_metaball.c to the build.

	* src/libtclcad/tkImgFmtPIX.c: Include fb.h

	* src/archer/archer, src/archer/archer.bat:
	Added code to handle an argument.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Added the option to effectively toggle two sided lighting. Added a 
-noWaitCursor option to the draw method.

	* src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	Removed call to Tk_IsMapped (i.e. it was being called with a Display 
pointer instead of a Tk_Window. Also added code to provide an option to color 
back facing polgons differently than front facing ones.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Dm.tcl:
	If on Windows, change default display manager type to wgl instead of 
ogl.

2006-08-22  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c, src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl:
	Modified wdb_tree_cmd() and wdb_print_node() to provide the capabilities
	the help command cliams for the "tree" command. Also modified the
	helplib entry so that it agrees with the help message. This fixes bug
	#1480522.

2006-08-21  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/raytrace.h, src/librt/bundle.c, src/librt/db_lookup.c, 
src/librt/shoot.c, src/librt/storage.c, src/librt/vshoot.c:
	s/RT_RESOURCE_CHECK/RT_CK_RESOURCE/g .. we really don't need two macros 
that do the exact same check.  consolidate to just one sans a deprecation 
warning, using the prevalent CK convention instead.

2006-08-20  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c: break message into two lines on abort.

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	if mged was started in interactive mode and fails to create a display 
manager, revert to classic mode.

	* src/libdm/tcl.c:
	copy the name/port of the x11 server into a temporary buffer.  this 
avoids some odd stack corruption that is probably related to a bug somewhere 
else.  this is of course just masking tape over one of the symptoms more than 
likely.

	* src/libdm/query.c:
	don't use the HAVE_XOPENDISPLAY define, configure doesn't provide it 
atm anyways.  instead merge in the logic pertaining to checking for X and/or 
GLX into their respective sections.

2006-08-19  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/dm-X.c, src/libdm/dm-glx.c, src/libdm/dm-ogl.c, 
src/libdm/dm-pex.c, src/libdm/dm-tk.c, src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	make sure we actually got a display before proceeding with the display 
manager initialization.  this prevents the display manager from crashing out 
quickly upon startup when some condition fails (like there not being an X11 
server to connect to, then attempting to get the size of that display or a 
screen, etc)

	* src/libtclcad/tkCanvBezier.c:
	make sure the display isn't null before proceeding.  really shouldn't 
ever be if we got this far, but if it is, we avoid a crash. add a localvar 
footer while we're at it

	* configure.ac:
	try glGetBooleanv() instead of glClear() to prevent crashing when 
there's no context

2006-08-18  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	stub out metaball editing stuff and wire it into -c mode

2006-08-18  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c: meh, reorder

	* src/mged/dodraw.c:
	missed one.  should always initialize structures that utilize magic 
number checking prior to any use including being passed around as function 
arguments.  initialize a variety of struct rt_db_internal that were being 
passed to transform_editing_solid() uninitialized.

	* src/mged/edsol.c, src/mged/facedef.c, src/mged/inside.c:
	should always initialize structures that utilize magic number checking

2006-08-17  jlowenz  <jlowenz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/pkg.h, src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	added a new function: pkg_permserver_ip to support connecting to the 
loopback interface. involved some refactoring. not completely tested yet.

2006-08-16  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/enumerate.sh, sh/vers.sh:
	should escape the quotes since they're inside quotes

	* sh/vers.sh:
	use a somewhat more safe means to extract the version number from 
configure.ac

	* sh/enumerate.sh:
	add = in the version string just to minimize the chance it's something 
that will not evaluate.

	* sh/enumerate.sh: output the date and version of BRL-CAD

2006-08-16  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c: added metaball to the "make" command

2006-08-16  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	john fixed the bug where the dxf-g converter was improperly handling 
files encoded with a different line ending style (e.g. CR+NL or CR only).  this 
was done by implementing bu_fgets() that takes CR's into account.  still need 
to test more and probably update all of the callers of fgets() but it's there 
now.

	* NEWS: john improved end-of-line file input processing in dxf-g

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	use the rt_matrix_transform() call from librt instead of hooking into 
the rt_functab directly.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am, src/librt/transform.c:
	initial implementation of rt_matrix_transform() routine for applying a 
matrix transformation to a given object.  basically a convenient wrapper to not 
needlessly expose the rt_functab table to userland code.

	* include/raytrace.h:
	declare the newly added rt_matrix_transform() routine for applying a 
matrix transformation to a given object

2006-08-16  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: Added bu_fgets()

	* src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	Now uses bu_fgets() so that DXF files that use CR as an EOL marker will 
be read correctly

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/bu_fgets.c:
	Added bu_fgets(). A replacement for fgets() that also recognizes CR as 
an EOL marker

2006-08-15  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/Makefile.am, sh/enumerate.sh, sh/lines.sh:
	renamed lines.sh to enumerate.sh and added more than just line counting 
to the report summary.  the output now also includes details on the number of 
files/directories as well as the number of libraries and applications that are 
compiled/installed.

	make RT_NAMESIZE obsolete, remove from public interface header.  retain 
the v4 support for 16 char object names using a local define.

	* NEWS:
	support for longer Fastgen object names in fast4-g.. should allow for 
longer length object names when performing a conversion instead of seemingly 
arbitrarily limiting the names to 16 characters.  this change is made in 
response to sf feature request 1539998 (FastGen to BRL-CAD converter truncates

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	remove the deleted regular expression implementation files

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.dsp, misc/win32-msvc/brlcad.dsw, 
src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp, src/other/libregex/Makefile.am, 
src/other/libregex/libregex.dsp:
	remove the obsolete regular expression implementation in src/libsysv,
	using the more up-to-date in src/other/libregex

	* src/libbn/libbn.dsp:
	remove asize.c file -- was refactored into src/libfb/asize.c

2006-08-10  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/dm-X.c:
	cleanup the lengthy repetition of pub_vars and priv_vars using some 
local vars pointers, ws too

	* src/mged/Makefile.am, src/mged/dm-tk.c:
	initial DM_TK mged wrapper interface to libdm's interface (written by 
Tim Myers) disabled from build for now

	* src/liboptical/sh_plastic.c:
	PM_Visualize is not used if this is RT_MULTISPECTRAL, protect 
accordingly so we don't end up with undefined symbols

	* src/liboptical/Makefile.am:
	liboptical is once again no longer dependent upon libfb

	* src/liboptical/sh_billboard.c:
	decouple from libfb, don't bother trying to autosize the image based on 
the file name -- use the provided size

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am, src/libfb/if_tk.c:
	add an initial Tk framebuffer interface (implemented by Tim Myers), 
disabled from the build for now

	* src/libfb/fb_generic.c:
	add Tk to the list of known interfaces if IF_TK is defined

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libdm/dm-tk.c:
	add initial DM_TK interface (from Tim Myers)

	* include/fbio.h: initial steps for a Tk interface, if IF_TK is defined

	* include/Makefile.am, include/dm-tk.h:
	add initial DM_TK interface header (from Tim Myers)

	* src/libbu/mread.c: quell warning

	* TODO:
	lots of new ideas to do.  full precision support, c++ geometry API, 
geometry voxelizer, geometry/image converter libraries, validation tests 
confirming various computations.

	* HACKING:
	when making a release, utilize the NEWS file as appropriate as a basis 
for making release announcements.  either way, the announcements almost ALWAYS 
require tailored customization.

2006-08-09  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc/brlcad.dsw:
	libtclcad isn't really needed for the library build for most ray-trace 
purpose applications.  it'd only be useful if someone wanted to manually 
compile the mged sources and then use this to link against.  since that doesn't 
currently seem to be a need, going ahead and reverting/removing it.

	* NEWS, TODO, src/mged/tedit.c:
	fairly comprehensive rewrite of tedit() for the ted command that merges 
the windows version in with the unix version in what should be a pretty 
platform independent manner.  this version tries a lot harder to find a usable 
editor other than /bin/ed including checking EDITOR even on Windows (there was 
some bug report for this, but can't find it atm).  it'll also kick off TextEdit 
on Mac OS X now as well as trying emacs and vi, before falling back on jove as 
the editor if it can find it.  still doesn't do run-time checking of the editor 
itself, but it should be more consistent.  also removed the closing of 
descriptors which lets console editors work and allows gui editors to be aborted

2006-08-08  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/if_X.c, src/libfb/if_ogl.c, src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	avoid debug mode namespace conflicts when multiple interfaces are 
compiled and HIDDEN becomes /**/)

	* src/liboptical/sh_null.c:
	avoid debug mode namespace conflicts with libfb's null interface (where 
HIDDEN becomes /**/)

	* src/liboptical/sh_stack.c:
	avoid debug mode namespace conflicts with libfb's stack interface 
(where HIDDEN becomes /**/)

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	final mod to allow for arbitrary counts of light point samples.  the 
point sample array is allocated in batches of SOME_LIGHT_SAMPLES.

	* include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	next step in the incremental update, dynamically allocate the light 
sample points array instead of using a fixed size.

	* misc/Makefile.defs:
	be sure to delete static and other 'regular' or noinst libraries during 
a make noprod

	* include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	incremental update this time.. change MAX_LIGHT_SAMPLES to 
SOME_LIGHT_SAMPLES

	* NEWS:
	fixed mged crash on P binding when not in edit mode.  this fixes sf bug 
1375751 (P shuts down mged) reported by bob2.

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	not_state now reports the desired state, so no need to print a message. 
 be consistent with the printing and the command name category (sedit).

	* src/mged/buttons.c:
	print out the expected/desired state so the user has a clue as to what 
to do to resolve the problem when not in the right editing mode.

	* src/mged/chgtree.c:
	not_state() now reports the desired state too, so no need for the extra 
printing

	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	add a lot of checks for valid pointers as part of isolating a 'P' 
binding crash bug (sf bug 1375751: P shuts down mged).  the crash was the 
result of a bus error inside of Tcl_AppendResult of all places, where the 
second Tcl_AppendResult() after the one inside not_state() would cause a crash. 
 this may indicate some other interp initialization problem, but the fix in 
place does seem to keep things going nicely.

	* src/tclscripts/mged/callbacks.tcl:
	quell warnings about mged_display not being set, make sure the 
variables even exist

	* src/libfb/if_stack.c, src/libfb/if_sun.c, src/libfb/if_ts.c,

src/libfb/fblocal.h, src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c:
	get rid of the libfb-specific _LOCAL_ macro, instead using HIDDEN like 
everyone else (currently still provided by machine.h)

	* src/mged/chgview.c, src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/vrlink.c:
	enable the 'pov' command, getting rid of the peculiar undocumented 
TCP_FILES define.  move cmd_pov over to chgview.c like the comment suggests. 
(note that the command guts are over in librt)

	* src/mged/dm-X.c, src/mged/dm-ogl.c, src/mged/dm-wgl.c, 
src/mged/mged_dm.h:
	move the common_dm() decl over to mged_dm.h

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	remove apparently dead code, 'do_2nd_attach_prompt()'

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	looks like bezier canvas support should now be available for both 
windows studio build projects. libtclcad should build sans tk sources now, try 
enabling it.

	* misc/win32-msvc/brlcad.dsw:
	add libtclcad to the msvc brlcad dll build workspace

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am: add the new windows build file to the dist

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	make vers.c correctly rebuild if a source file changes

	* src/libtclcad/libtclcad.dsp:
	take a manual stab at an initial msvc build file for libtclcad (needed 
for the sketch editor)

	* src/libdm/dm-ogl_win.c:
	removed the replaced file.  dm-ogl_win.c is no more, replaced by the 
dm-wgl.c interface file.

	* src/nirt/if.c, src/remrt/remrt.1, src/tclscripts/mged/anim.tcl,

	get rid of the old 'cad' path references/assumptions

	* doc/mged.tr, doc/html/manuals/mged/mug, 
doc/html/manuals/mged/mug_camo:
	get rid of the old path

	* doc/html/manuals/mged/Makefile.am, doc/html/manuals/mged/bugs:
	get rid of doc/html/manuals/mged/bugs .. the main bug in there was 
verified to still be a problem and was added to the BUGS file.  either way, we 
don't need this old 'bugs' file any more.

	* BUGS:
	debugbu 2 immediately reports a bu_vls_free() error.. apparently been a 
problem since 4.5 days at least (bug found in doc/html/manuals/mged/bugs)

	* src/mged/buttons.c, src/mged/chgtree.c, src/mged/cmd.c,

src/mged/mgedtcl.h, src/mged/update.c, src/mged/attach.c:
	decouple DM_X from the other display manager interfaces, clean up the 
preprocessor logic so Windows does not need to declare DM_X but also to avoid 
using _WIN32 where possible as well.

	* configure.ac: check for pipe()

	* src/libdm/dm-generic.c, src/libdm/dm_obj.c, src/libdm/libdm.dsp, 
src/libdm/query.c, src/libdm/tcl.c:
	decouple DM_X from the other display manager interfaces, clean up the 
preprocessor logic so Windows does not need to declare it

	* misc/win32-msvc7/mged/mged.vcproj:
	don't define DM_X, should be only using DM_WGL now on Windows

2006-08-07  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/doevent.c: ws

	* src/libdm/dm_obj.c: header cleanup, get rid of _WIN32

	* include/dm_xvars.h:
	collapse the two structures into one, even though the structure really 
should NOT be serving double-duty and be compile-time variable-width..  doesn't 
allow multiple interfaces to be simultaneously compiled.  should absorb the 
interface into dm-X.h and friends at some point.

	* include/dm-X.h: cleanup, ws

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libdm/libdm.vcproj, 
misc/win32-msvc7/libfb/libfb.vcproj, src/libdm/dm-glx.c, 
src/libfb/fb_generic.c, src/libfb/tcl.c:
	decouple IF_X from the other framebuffer interfaces (ogl and wgl in 
particular).  Windows should not define IF_X unless they want the X11 interface.

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c: reword away if_4d.c

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am, src/libfb/if_4d-old.c:
	mark the if_4d-old interface as now obsolete, no longer shipping the 
sources leaving it to cvs history

	* src/libfb/fb_generic.c, src/libfb/if_ogl.c, src/libfb/if_remote.c, 
src/libfb/if_wgl.c, include/fbio.h:
	IF_4D interface is not really shipped any more, don't talk about it

	* src/remrt/Makefile.am:
	remrt does use libfb directly and needs to declare the dependency even 
if another dependency also uses it.  libtool is supposed to sort it all out

	* src/mged/mged_dm.h: no longer need the ogl_ogl externs..

	* src/mged/dm-ogl.c:
	no longer need the _WIN32 section, they get their own dm-wgl.c interface

	* src/libdm/dm-glx.c:
	remove the old DM_OGL hack on the GLX interface.. move towards 
decoupling the two

	* src/mged/dm-wgl.c:
	add a new dm-wgl.c interface for windows to use instead of piggypacking 
off of the ogl interface

	* misc/win32-msvc7/mged/mged.vcproj:
	compile the new dm-wgl.c interface instead of dm-ogl.c now on Windows

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libdm/libdm.vcproj:
	windows uses dm-wgl.c now, not dm-ogl_win.c .. the latter exists no more

src/libfb/if_ogl_win32.c, src/mged/dm-X.c:
	remove the if_ogl_win32.c interface .. Windows platforms should now be 
using the if_wgl.c interface instead

include/fbio.h:
	add explicit code for DM_WGL and IF_WGL for Windows GL support instead 
of piggybacking off of the OGL interface

	* include/dm.h:
	revert, wrong edited dm.h.. not yet ready for the tk interface

	* include/dm.h: unnecesary IF_OGL define

	* include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	revert the unlimited lights change briefly until it is determined why 
they are not working for area light sources

	* src/mged/Makefile.am: dm-tk.c isn't ready yet

2006-08-06  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/PROJECTS: spel chek

	* doc/PROJECTS:
	clean up the introductory description paragraph a little

	* doc/Makefile.am: add PROJECTS and IDEAS to the list of documentation

	* doc/PROJECTS:
	BRL-CAD is comprised of several isolatable projects that have specific
	distinguishing qualities of utility that make them useful as
	stand-alone projects to a wide audience of users.  In some cases,
	these projects may be independently maintained and are sometimes
	independently distributed.  These projects are described in this file.

	* src/other/jove/findcom.c: quell warnings about implicit declarations

2006-08-04  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Fixed point value function (f^2/r^2 instead of f/r^2).  Fixed steppers
	"dist left" concept. (those two fix 'large' object rendering). Renamed
	and deleted variables for readability.

2006-08-03  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c: Major fixes to bounding sphere generation.
	Break bigger functions down a bit for reuse and easier reading.
	Draw the bounding sphere in rt_metaball_plot (may be backed out later).

2006-08-03  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/Makefile.am, src/libfb/tcl.c:
	add support for the new 'wgl' WindowsGL interface

	* src/libfb/libfb.dsp:
	use IF_WGL now instead of IF_OGL, as well as if_wgl.c instead of 
if_ogl_win32.c

	* src/libfb/if_X24.c:
	avoid crash -- if the interface is null, just return

	* src/bwish/tcl.c: init array to zero

	* sh/lines.sh:
	compute how many lines of the source code are actually blank and don't 
include those numbers in the totals for a slightly better/invariant 
approximation

2006-08-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	forgot to mention that this fixes sf bug #1469502: FreeBSD6/amd64 rt 
segfault when optimization enabled

2006-08-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Implemented rt_metaball_class. Fixed a_onehit handling in 
rt_metaball_shot.

2006-08-02  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKING:
	minor comment about keeping docs up to date, communicating changes

	* NEWS: improved FreeBSD 64bit support, fix AMD64 crash

2006-08-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/machine.h: adding {free,open,net}bsd to the ugly hackery

2006-08-02  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c: Corrected the compile instructions

2006-08-01  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Shoot all the way through if ap->a_onehit is not true (opposed to 
through the first in/out pair).
	Apply the 'stepping' optimization to walking after the first hit.
	Minor cleanup for -Wall -Werror -ansi -pedantic.

	* src/remrt/Makefile.am:
	since liboptical now deplibs libfb, we can remove libfb from the 
explicit ldadd

	* src/liboptical/Makefile.am:
	sh_billboard.c requires libfb for fb_common_name_size, so add it to the 
deplibs

	* src/remrt/Makefile.am: rtsrv needs libfb

	* src/conv/off/Makefile.am: LIBRT moved to RT

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Drastically improved bounding sphere computation (better center and 
fit).
	Fix for 'garbage' normals resulting in noisy images in some situations.
	Obey the 'one-hit' flag in the shot routine.

2006-08-01  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/patch/Makefile.am: use RT now instead of LIBRT

	* src/conv/jack/Makefile.am: g-jack needs his libraries too

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	compile if_wgl.c now that it'll check for IF_WGL being defined

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c: update names, s/ogl/wgl/

	* configure.ac: bah, another.. wgl_link_works, not gl_link_works

	* configure.ac: oops, typo.. close the macro

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	check for the WITH_WGL symbol from configure to add the WGL cflags

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am, src/tab/Makefile.am, src/vdeck/Makefile.am, 
src/librtserver/Makefile.am, src/libwdb/Makefile.am, src/mk/Makefile.am,

src/burst/Makefile.am, src/bwish/Makefile.am, src/conv/comgeom/Makefile.am, 
src/conv/iges/Makefile.am, src/conv/jack/Makefile.am:
	update the usage of LIBRT from configure to be RT instead so that it is 
consistent with the other BU, BN, WDB etc library defines, using the LIB prefix 
mostly on third party or external libraries instead.

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am: add the new if_wgl.c file, not yet compiled

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	initial stub of a libfb IF_WGL 'wgl' interface to replace usage of 
'ogl' on Windows.  this is done to support the libdm design intent of 
interfaces for each style of display manager, instead of piggy-backing on top 
of 'ogl' and complicating the code with preprocessor WIN32 checks everywhere.  
haven't updated the names/code yet.. just a stub file.

	* src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	add an initial implementation of a WindowsGL 'wgl' libdm interface 
using the former dm-ogl_win32.c code as a basis.  remove the XGL sections and 
add boilerplate checks that makes sure this interface can be compiled alongside 
the 'ogl' interface.  expects DM_OGL to be defined in order to get 
functionality.

	* src/rttherm/viewtherm.c:
	use the main light.h header, not the (now gone) private src/rt/light.h 
header

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am:
	add dm-wgl.c to the compilation list based on the WITH_WGL automake 
symbol being defined by configure -- this allows the wgl interface to be 
simultaneously compiled alongside the ogl interface

	* src/libbn/Makefile.am:
	remove asize.c file -- was refactored into src/libfb/asize.c

	* src/adrt/libcommon/Makefile.am: removed comment

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libtclcad/libtclcad.vcproj, 
misc/win32-msvc7/mged/mged.vcproj:
	use the DM_WGL interface instead of DM_OGL

	* include/Makefile.am: install the new dm-wgl.h header

	* src/libfb/compress.c:
	remove the obsolete compress.c file .. can be restored from revision 
history should someone really ever need to revisit compression on such old 
hardware

	* src/libsysv/engine.c, src/libsysv/regcomp.c, src/libsysv/regerror.c, 
src/libsysv/regex2.h, src/libsysv/regexec.c, src/libsysv/regfree.c, 
src/libsysv/utils.h, src/libsysv/cclass.h, src/libsysv/cname.h:
	remove the obsolete regular expression implementation, there is a 
src/other/libregex that is more up-to-date.

	* src/rt/Makefile.am, src/rt/light.h:
	the 'local' light.h header was redundant with include/light.h so remove 
it

	* src/liboptical/sh_prj.c: unused/unnecessary ../rt/ext.h header

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	libfb now compiles asize.c as it was updated and refactored with the 
better libbn version.  compress.c is not really relevant/useful any longer.

	* src/libdm/dm-ogl.c:
	update comment to note that the ogl interface is specifically an X11 
OpenGL interface (i.e. it's XGL.. might want to rename it to that someday, but 
oh well).  ws

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libdm/libdm.vcproj:
	use the new DM_WGL interface instead of the former DM_OGL interface so 
that the latter may also be compiled at the same time (e.g. cygwin/mingw 
environments) but also to allow the ogl interface to consistently imply just 
one interface.

	* misc/win32-msvc7/fbserv/fbserv.vcproj:
	fbserv_win.c was consolidated into fbserv.c

	* NEWS, include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	allow unlimited light samples during ray-tracing instead of a fixed 
compile-time count (was 128)

	* include/dm-ogl.h:
	make the 'ogl' interface be X11 OpenGL only.  windows is being moved to 
its own 'wgl' interface

	* include/dm-wgl.h:
	initial dm-wgl.h header for a new 'wgl' interface, separating it from 
the X11-based ogl interface and cleaning up the code

	* configure.ac:
	try enabling the automatic detection/compilation of tcl/tk now that 
tkCanvasBezier is cleaned up to not use internal Tk headers.  probably still 
need to work on Tcl autopath issues, but give it a shot.  also add a slew of 
checks for WGL so that a new framebuffer and display manager interface may be 
defined on Windows that is separate from the ogl interface.  this is important 
for cygwin/mingw systems where it is possible to use both wgl and ogl style 
interfaces simultaneously.  also rename LIBRT to RT to be consistent with the 
other BRL-CAD library AC_SUBST values

	* src/fbserv/Makefile.am, src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/fbserv/fbserv_win.c:
	refactor fbserv.c and fbserv_win.c so that there is only one file that 
supports/contains all of the mods that fbserv_win.c was presuming.  this needs 
testing but is more functionally clean, relying on configure-style 
tests/defines instead of WIN32 where easily possible

	* src/util/pixcut.c, src/util/pixhalve.c, src/util/pixmorph.c,

include/bn.h, include/fb.h, src/canon/Makefile.am, src/canon/asize.c:
	refactor the three asize.c implementations (libbn, libfb, & canon) into 
just one.  libbn had the most comprehensive and updated version, but the logic 
belongs in libfb.  so, the bn_common autosizing functions are now consolidated 
to libfb, refactoring accordingly.

	* src/rt/worker.c:
	reorder functions so that forward declarations are not needed

	* src/rt/ext.h: don't need to (nor should we) declare worker() here

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	run the provided function single-threaded even if bu_parallel() is 
called on a system that doesn't have PARALLEL support compiled in

	* include/config_win.h:
	windows apparently doesn't have socklen_t defined, so make it an int so 
that WIN32 hacks can be removed

	* src/libtclcad/tkImgFmtPIX.c:
	removing the asize.c bn_common_* file autosizing functions, 
consolidating them to libfb.  so update the function names to fb_ now

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadTkSetup.c: remove old comment

	* src/libtclcad/tkCanvBezier.c:
	finally rewrite tkCanvBezier to NOT use libtk internal headers (as it 
was written as a proper new libtk Canvas type, but hasn't been pushed through 
the tcl/tk 'TIP' process).  this change should make it feasible to compile this 
code without having to have a copy of the Tk sources around .. more testing 
needed.

2006-07-31  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/proc-db/picket_fence.c:
	fixed incorrect parameter usage of mk_lcomb .. takes an array of three 
char values, not a string of colors

	* src/liboptical/shade.c: quell warning, takes floats not fastf_t's

2006-07-30  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	new script for computing BRL-CAD file line counts.  this computes the 
line counts of the various categories of files in the project including 
documentation, source code (distinguishing header code from non-header source 
code), 3rd party code (e.g. tcl/tk, png, urt, etc), and build system files.

	* sh/lines.sh:
	instead of using the 'total' summary from the wc command, calculate the 
sum directly ourselves using a simple sum function. this slows things down 
considerably, but is necessary to avoid the default behavior of xargs on linux 
that can break up a piped stream into multiple invocations (resulting in 
multiple total lines).

	* sh/lines.sh: consistent line lengths

	* src/util/lowp.c: missing std headers

	* src/rt/viewxray.c, src/sig/interp.c: quell warning

	* src/libdm/clip.c:
	quell warning on INFINITY (again), instead renaming the define to 
CLIP_DISTANCE (just without changing the value this time)

	* src/README:
	add an introductory header that hopefully better explains the various 
content in the src/ directory as well as a basic summary of just what it 
comprises before getting into the individual content dirs

	* sh/Makefile.am: add the new lines.sh script

	* sh/lines.sh:
	initial revision of a new tool that computes how many lines of code 
BRL-CAD uses.  this separates the code into various categories such as 
documentation, build system, non-project code, and the actual source code.

	* misc/Makefile.am:
	pro/e is no longer in this directory, same logic moved to src/external

	* configure.ac:
	make the 'whether to build against OpenGL' test actually run a function 
that it has to link against so that it doesn't erroneously pass and leave 
OpgnGL enabled when there is no library but headers exist.

	* include/rtgeom.h:
	can only use 4 bytes, not 5 on the RT_METABALL_INTERNAL_MAGIC .. made 
it 'ball' instead of 'mball'

2006-07-29  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* COPYING:
	revert -- I doubt these changes support the intel mac parallel code.. 
careful not to commit COPYING as it is often automatically overwritten by

2006-07-29  lbutler  <lbutler@users.sourceforge.net>

	* COPYING, INSTALL, include/machine.h, src/libbu/parallel.c:
	changes to support Intel Mac parallel code

2006-07-28  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/ProEngineer/.cvsignore:
	oop, forgot to add the .cvsignore file moved from misc/pro-engineer.  
add it.

	* configure.ac:
	add configuration options supporting the Unigraphics importer, 
providing the BUILD_UG symbol if it is to be compiled (used in src/external)

	* src/external/README:
	include a blurb about the Unigraphics/NX importer.

	* configure.ac:
	src/conv/unigraphics was moved to src/external/Unigraphics, so update 
the corresponding Makefile generation

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	add Unigraphics to the subdirectory list, moved over from 
src/conv/unigraphics to here since it relies on the external UGOPEN 
api/libraries

	* src/conv/Makefile.am:
	the unigraphics directory is no longer stashed here, it moved to 
src/external/Unigraphics

	* src/external/Unigraphics/Makefile.am, 
src/external/Unigraphics/conv.h, src/external/Unigraphics/log.h, 
src/external/Unigraphics/ug-g.1, src/external/Unigraphics/ug-g.c, 
src/external/Unigraphics/ug_misc.c, src/external/Unigraphics/ug_misc.h:
	moved the Unigraphics importer from src/conv/unigraphics to 
src/external/Unigraphics since it requires the external UGOPEN library api.

	* configure.ac: add some additional pro/engineer enable aliases

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	distribute the new README as part of the source dist (oh yeah, the 
README also includes details on the Pro/Engineer plugin for starters)

	* src/external/README:
	describe the contents of this directory and its intent

	* configure.ac:
	misc/pro-engineer was moved to src/external so update the output 
Makefiles accordingly as well as the new src/external/Makefile and the plugin 
resource files

	* src/Makefile.am:
	traverse into src/external for all builds since there may be something 
to build in there if it was enabled

	* src/external/Makefile.am, src/external/ProEngineer/Makefile.am, 
src/external/ProEngineer/install.doc, src/external/ProEngineer/mk.in, 
src/external/ProEngineer/proe-brl.c, src/external/ProEngineer/proe_brl.res, 
src/external/ProEngineer/proe_brl_error.res, 
src/external/ProEngineer/proe_brl_gen_error.res, 
src/external/ProEngineer/protk.dat.in, src/external/ProEngineer/usermsg.txt:
	move the Pro/Engineer plugin from misc/pro-engineer to 
src/external/ProEngineer.  the new src/external directory is intended for all 
of the codes that are written to work with and link against external packages 
(often as a plugin to said external package)

	* src/mged/ged.c: ws

	* src/libfb/tcl.c:
	go ahead and check for valid parameters to fb_refresh even if this 
isn't IF_X

	* src/tclscripts/archer/pkgIndex.tcl:
	revert the inadvertent loss of the Archer package

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl, src/tclscripts/archer/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/archer/tclIndex:
	look for commands in the plugin 'Commands' directory instead of 
'Command' to be consistent with 'Wizards'

	* doc/description.txt:
	add a tidbit on some of the humorous incorrect pronounciations that 
have been overheard as well as an explanation of where the name BRL-CAD comes 
from

2006-07-27  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/plugins/Makefile.am:
	directory renamed from Command to Commands

	* src/archer/plugins/Commands/Makefile.am, 
src/archer/plugins/Commands/README:
	bah, named the directory incorrectly .. files moved from Command to 
Commands directory

	* src/archer/Makefile.am:
	there's the culprit, the files are in plugins, not here..

	* src/archer/Makefile.am:
	oop, readd Commands, Core, and Utility directories

	* configure.ac:
	generate Makefiles for the src/archer/plugins/Commands Core and Utility 
directories

	* src/archer/plugins/Core/Makefile.am, 
src/archer/plugins/Utility/Makefile.am:
	initial Makefile.am file to create this directory as part of the 
install hierarchy, installing the README as a bit of trivial documentation.

	* src/archer/plugins/Core/README, src/archer/plugins/Utility/README:
	add simple initial README file to describe the intended purpose of this 
directory (i'm guessing here)

	* src/archer/plugins/Makefile.am:
	rename the data dir variable from documentation to plugins to reflect 
usage intent; add Core to the list of traversal dirs

2006-07-27  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl: Add code for loading Core plugins

2006-07-26  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Check-in for Doug. Mods to remember the last directory searcher for a 
database. Added more menu entries for transparency.

2006-07-26  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c: Initial plot impl.
	Removed the 16pt stub (use ell's instead).
	Minor indentation cleanup.

2006-07-26  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/plugins/Makefile.am: Add Command and Utility to SUBDIRS.

	* src/libdm/dm_obj.c: Add drawScale command.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Added support for displaying a scale in the geometry window. Added 
support for dynamically adding methods to the Archer class.

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl: Add help for the viewDir command.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Display.tcl, src/tclscripts/lib/Dm.tcl:
	Add support for displaying a scale.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/QuadDisplay.tcl:
	Add viewDir method. Add methods to support the scale.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/View.tcl:
	Add method/wrapper for the viewDir command.

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	Change the conditional from <= to < in a few places to prevent indexing 
to far.

2006-07-26  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	minor shot hack for performance, with a tweaked up "final step", this 
is about 104x faster on my test case

2006-07-26  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/view_obj.c: Added the viewDir command.

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c: Minor mods of a few comments.

2006-07-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/IDEAS:
	Modify Kaleido to output BRL-CAD geometry ( 
http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~rl/kaleido/ )

	* TODO: modify the new tree traversal code to be generic

2006-07-25  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Fixed the prep so it has 'real' bounding volume generation.
	Change the STEP define to a step var in preparation for a possible 
optimization.

2006-07-25  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c: solaris doesn't have isblank()

2006-07-25  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	Prep, render, shot, and normal implemented (but quite slow).
	Fixed an offset bug in the import5 func.

2006-07-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	oop,  isn't set until after the environment is checked (and usage is 
potentially before the env check) so just use echo

	* BUGS:
	mged View menu says I and O are keybindings for zoom in/out -- they are 
apparently not

2006-07-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	woot, this little "script" is in excess of 1000 lines... in 
celebration, finally break tradition with other autogen.sh convention by adding 
a more useful --help option instead of passing it on to configure.  also add 
support to override any of the command (autoreconf, automake, etc) options via 
a set of _OPTIONS environment variables.

	* AUTHORS: bowers middle is anthony, so sayeth the rtedge manpage

	* autogen.sh:
	allow environment variable overrides on AUTORECONF, AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE, 
LIBTOOLIZE, ACLOCAL, AUTOHEADER.  fix --help so it works again (need to rewrite 
so it's not just a configure pass-through)

	* NEWS: speling

	* autogen.sh:
	add a manual_autogen function that runs the manual configuration steps. 
 this makes it possible to add support for manual recursive configure build 
support.

2006-07-23  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/mike-tux.ppm:
	The file in the cvs repository was corrupted. Sean, be careful when 
using scripts to update all files :-)

2006-07-23  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	utilize the RUN_RECURSIVE define so that we don't recurse more than 
once during autogening

	* autogen.sh:
	allow external overrides on HELP, QUIET, VERBOSE, and VERSION_ONLY.  
document the settable project defaults

	* autogen.sh:
	yet another fairly massive rewrite, this time mostly just 
restructuring.  keep track of the basename for better output messages and 
refactor the initialization steps into a function.  also refactor the libtool 
failure check into a function while we're at it as well.  all steps towards 
being able to cleanly handle manual build steps of projects using recursive 
configure. oh, and this change removes the directory change to the autogen.sh 
script, so it must once again be run from the top source dir at least for the 
time being.

2006-07-22  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc7/librt/librt.vcproj:
	no longer need to define IMPORT_FASTGEN4_SECTION

	* autogen.sh:
	detect a recursive configure, it's not really properly supported yet.. 
but if the problem is glibtool, we should be able to continue through a restart 
with LIBTOOLIZE set

2006-07-21  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/raytrace.h:
	Always compile the fastgen4 import stuff. (bob1961)

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	minor bugfix, implemented "describe" and "ifree"

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	v5 import/export implemented. Removed v4 stubs. Made all stubs log.

	* src/mged/typein.c:
	metaball: minor cleanup, and save threshhold to struct

	* src/librt/table.c: point to the v5 export/import, not v4...

2006-07-17  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/Makefile.am: simple reorder

	* misc/brlcad.spec.in:
	update the rpm build spec file using more configure autoconf variables

	* doc/Makefile.am: install the pad_file.xml

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl, src/tclscripts/lib/Drawable.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/mged/plot.tcl, src/mged/overlay.c:

2006-07-14  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/typein.c:
	Initial metaball parser (heavily based on pipes) and minor cleanup.

	* include/rtgeom.h, include/wdb.h:
	store metaball control points in a bu_list of structs instead of an 
array of homogenous vectors

	* src/librt/Makefile.am, src/librt/g_metaball.c, src/librt/table.c:
	initial metaball support (skeletal)

	* include/db5.h, include/raytrace.h, include/rtgeom.h:

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	s/HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS/HAVE_SYS_UN_H/g now that there is a new 
check in configure.ac

	* configure.ac:
	check for the sys/un.h header in order to stop using the 
HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS define

	* src/libbu/linebuf.c:
	make linux less unhappy, setlinebuf() apparently returns void on linux 
so prefer to use setvbuf() when available so we can catch any error

2006-07-12  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/vas4/vas_io.c:
	clean up the logic on termio.h vs sgtty.h .. can't use both together

	* src/mged/ged.h, src/mged/attach.c: declare mged_link_vars() correctly

	* doc/description.txt, README: s/from/form/

2006-07-11  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README, doc/description.txt, doc/pad_file.xml.in:
	emphasize cross-platform open source instead of comprehensive 
(technically not comprehensive CAD to say the least)

	* src/canon/Makefile.am: png-ipu needs LIBPNG

	* configure.ac: gah, set LIBDS, not LIBDL

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	ged.h declares is_dm_null() now, bump clone version in anticipation of 
getting it to work here shortly

	* src/mged/ged.c: ged.h now declares the attach.c funcs

	* src/mged/ged.h:
	declare is_dm_null() and mged_link_vars() so callers don't have to

	* src/canon/canon.h, src/canon/canonize.c, src/canon/ipuscan.c, 
src/canon/ipustat.c, src/canon/pix-ipu.c, src/canon/png-ipu.c:
	clean up the code to remove the #if IRIX junk and instead consistently 
use IPU_FULL_LIB which is declared by the canon.h interface header, and that 
define is set when dslib.h was detected by configure.

	* src/canon/Makefile.am:
	add LIBDS to the link list, IRIX systems actually compile in 
functionality provided by that generic SCSI library

	* configure.ac:
	add a header check for dslib.h and libds for SDL /dev/scsi library 
availability.  src/canon needs it.

	* src/util/dunncomm.c:
	tty.sg_* is not mixable with ioctl/termios so make it a #else

src/libfb/adage.h:
	refactor away the old BSD block defines among other simple cleanup

	* src/util/ttcp.c:
	remove the old BSD hack as the define is no longer necessary nor used 
by the BRL-CAD build system any longer

	* src/libsysv/bsdselect.c:
	update to 1990, assume basic bsd/posix conformance and availability of 
select.  get rid of BSD defines.

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	get rid of the now unused BSD define hack. use the configure check 
header symbols instead of platform foo including the new HAVE_WINSOCK_H

	* include/config_win.h:
	windows generally has the winsock.h header if we're compiling there .. 
it's a better define than _WIN32 for the windows platform when dealing with 
network code

	* configure.ac: check for winsock.h header

	* src/liborle/rle.c:
	also get rid of the old commented out 'speed boost' code that avoided

	get rid of the old commented out 'speed boost' code that avoided the 
'expensive' getc() call

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/memset.c:
	remove memset.c from libbu.  memset() is provided by libsysv if it's 
not available.  doesn't make sense as part of libbu unless we plan on making a 
bu_memset or somesuch.

	* src/libsysv/memset.c:
	add the license header, intending to get rid of the duplicate 
src/libbu/memset.c, updating ws while we're at it.

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/getopt.c:

	add additional error checking to make sure a -1 return value from 
read() is handled

	* src/util/lowp.c:
	revive lowp, updating the code to use bu_malloc instead of malloc and 
adding additional error checking for the read() calls

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	revive lowp adding it back to the build, not clear why it was disabled.

	* src/fb/cat-fb.c, src/fb/fb-bw.c, src/fb/fb-orle.c: cleanup

	* src/libfb/if_ab.c, src/libpkg/pkg.c, src/canon/pix-ipu.c:
	more mread() cleanup.

	* AUTHORS:
	special thanks to karel kulhavy (clock3) for his contributions to date 
including numerous bug reports, a source patch, and several example geometric 
databases relating to his work on Ronja (http://ronja.twibright.com/3d/)

	* src/other/URToolkit/cnv/rletorla.c:
	apply Karel Kulhavy's (clock3) patch regarding a 'Tiny bug prevents 
compilation on OpenBSD' (sf patch 1519270)

	* src/util/buffer.c, src/util/dbcp.c, src/util/dunncomm.c, 
src/util/files-tape.c, src/util/pix-yuv.c, src/util/pixtile.c, 
src/util/yuv-pix.c:
	refactor the mread() calls to the new bu_mread() call.  the bu_mread() 
function doesn't call perror for you, so the caller may need to if they 
expected it before.

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	few more binaries rely on libbu (mread refactoring)

	* src/libbu/mread.c, include/bu.h:
	change the function signature from using ints to using long ints for 
the count, take a void* like read(), return a long (fixing the previous bogus 
void)

	* src/libbu/mread.c: wrong file name in header, use mread.c

	* src/fb/Makefile.am, src/fb/bw-fb.c, src/fb/pix-fb.c, 
src/libfb/if_ab.c:
	refactor utilizing bu_mread now from libbu

	* AUTHORS:
	miles seems to have been a code contributor, not just special thanks 
(mread() comments)

	* src/libbu/mread.c:
	attribute kudos to at least one of the apparent original authors (even 
though it's been reworked some), Robert S. Miles.

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	remove the useful 'example' mread code that was replaced by pkg_inget 
since mread is now available in libbu as bu_mread.  reorder pkg_inget so a decl 
is unnecessary.

	* src/canon/mread.c:
	remove the refactored mread.c file, moved to libbu/mread.c

	* src/canon/Makefile.am, src/canon/pix-ipu.c:
	refactored mread to libbu, so use bu_mread now

	* src/canon/png-ipu.c: unnecessary mread declaration

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am: add mread.c to the libbu build

	* include/bu.h:
	export the new bu_mread() function call so everyone gets to use it

	* src/libbu/mread.c:
	initial bu_mread() function to refactor the plethora of custom mread() 
variants throughout the code.  bu_mread() keeps reading until the requested 
number of bytes are read or an error occurs, an important behavior for pipes.

	* src/bwish/input.c, src/conv/conv-vg2g.c, src/conv/g-vrml.c, 
src/conv/g-x3d.c, src/conv/patch/patch-g.c:
	add error checking to various read() calls where a potential -1 result 
read error was not being taken into account

	* doc/.cvsignore:
	initial .cvsignore file to ignore the generated pad_file.xml

	* src/librt/g_extrude.c:
	oop, remove the ifdef block since testing is done

	* src/librt/g_extrude.c:
	unbreak the wireframe drawing logic.. something wierd is still going 
on.  also, try even harder to avoid crashing on a bad index by making sure we 
don't index past the bn_vlist points array.

	* NEWS:
	prevent crashing mged when trying to draw extrude primitives that use 
empty sketch primitives.

	simple statements like 'make x extrude' could cause this as well as 
using any (default) empty sketch.

	the wireframe drawing routing was getting stuck in an infinite loop 
allocating memory adding empty vlist items to the mged display list due to the 
comparison against a negative decrementing index.

	the code now checks for the empty sketch condition and informs the 
user. thanks to ValarQ for finding this bug.

	* NEWS: re-enabled png-ipu, pix-ipu, ipustat, ipuscan

	* src/Makefile.am:
	finally 'revive' the old canon directory back into enabled-by-default 
build status.  should now build/install png-ipu, pix-ipu, ipustat, ipuscan.

	* src/canon/.cvsignore: ignore the generated binaries

	* src/canon/canonserver.c:
	removed the canonserver target, the sources for this binary are 
dependent upon headers and libraries that are not evidently available; 
similarly it hasn't been compiled/distributed since at least the new build 
system has been in place.

	* src/canon/Makefile.am:
	add mread.c to pix-ipu and png-ipu targets.  disable the hopeless 
canonserver product that is dependent on headers and libs that aren't evidently 
available (and the tool has minimal utility in either respect.

	* src/canon/mread.c, src/canon/pix-ipu.c, src/canon/png-ipu.c:
	break out the common mread() function into its own file from pix-ipu 
and png-ipu, clean it up a little

2006-06-30  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	Always compile the fastgen4 import stuff. Also, if'out the prompt about 
hiding objects.

	* src/librt/importFg4Section.c:
	Always compile the fastgen4 import stuff.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Makefile.am: Added ShaderEdit.tcl to scripts.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/cursor.tcl:
	Do a "package require" using BLT instead of blt for all platforms. If 
this works out, I need to come back and remove the conditional.

	* src/other/blt/library/pkgIndex.tcl: Change default library path.

	* src/other/blt/library/Makefile.am:
	Add pkgIndex.tcl and tclIndex to brlcadscript_SCRIPTS.

	* src/other/blt/library/dd_protocols/Makefile.am:

	* NEWS:
	archer enhancements for displaying view parameters and updated archer 
splash screen from Bob

2006-06-29  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Display.tcl:
	Added code for displaying the viewing parameters.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/View.tcl:
	Modified the ae method to call the view object's ae command when 
getting the azel.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Added the option to show viewing parameters in the display window.

2006-06-27  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

2006-06-26  bob1961  <bob1961@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Tweaks for IVAVIEW/Sdb mode. Modify the importFg4Sections method (i.e. 
no longer calling _select_node).

	* src/tclscripts/archer/images/aboutArcher.png:
	Update with latest BRL-CAD logo.

2006-06-26  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	one more restructuring step, this time propagating the dbip so that the 
copy_ functions have the right signature to be used as a db_functree callback.  
instead of proliferating the usage of the dbip global pointer even further, 
only the top-level hook functions use the global then all other routines are 
using the one passed as an argument (denoted with _dbip instead of dbip to 
avoid shadowing).

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	another restructuring step.  propagate a resource pointer for librt and 
don't pass around the tcl interpreter directly so that we can use thses 
functions directly as db_functree callbacks (instead stash the interp into our 
state client data structure).

	* src/librt/db_walk.c: ws

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	begin efforts to port clone and tracker towards supporting v5 
databases.  the db_getmrec() function and associated union records are v4 
specific structures that don't apply to v5 so it basically needs to be 
reimplemented from scratch..  start by initializing all pointers to NULL and 
getting rid of the useless propagation of ClientData.

	* src/librt/db_io.c:
	comment that db_getmrec loads records into a buffer in v4 format

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	er, unless i'm blind, there's no difference between the _WIN32 and 
non-_WIN32 section.  collapse into one

	* TODO:
	clone is a priority for end-of-iteration, anything else is going to be 
gravy

	* configure.ac:
	calculate the day, month, year individually so that they may be 
substituted into autoconf template files.  add doc/pad_file.xml to the list of 
generated files

	* doc/Makefile.am:
	add pad_file.xml.in to the dist and clean up after it on a distclean

	* doc/pad_file.xml.in:
	Add an initial PAD template file for BRL-CAD.  The version and date 
details are filled in by configure so that the file doesn't have to keep 
getting updated (needs more work) during release time.  This file is used by a 
lot of on-line distribution sites (predominantly by shareware distributors, but 
others including open source too), so that it is easier to add the package to 
those on-line distribution sites.  PAD is Portable Application Description, an 
XML data description used by application authors to dissemminate information to 
anyone interested in their software products.

2006-06-24  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/Makefile.am:
	include cvs2cl.pl and rcs2log in source distributions

	* misc/rcs2log:
	add rcs2log for convenience, pulled from the cvs contrib directory, in 
case the local system doesn't happen to have rcs2log available.

	* NEWS:
	john continues to rock, provided improved mged grid zooming using pixel 
size to grid spacing instead of calculating the number of dots.  this was a 
follow up to sf bug #1233930.

	* NEWS:
	john fixed the mged hang caused by extreme grid zooming bug (sf bug 
#1233930).  Problem was integer overflow, Fix was to check for negative integer.

	* TODO:
	a quick means to generate a testing suite for all binaries with a 
little scripting

	* INSTALL:
	too many impatient folks don't actually read the Installing from Binary 
section and try to run configure/autogen.sh on a binary distribution so try to 
make it more clear up-front in the Quick Installation section, and move the 
binary instructions up higher in the file.

	* README:
	rewrite the introduction, using the new doc/description.txt details.  
now includes the portability heritage and portability details, details on the 
geometry representation types, and expanded details on what is provided 
tool-wise

	* doc/description.txt:
	Fill in ALL of the description details about BRL-CAD including 
different length description formats useful when preparing materials for 
informational websites, software distribution sites, package management 
systems, release announcement materials, and more.  includes links to 
frequently needed materials like the trackers, keywords/categories, and details 
on how to correctly refer to the project and even how to pronounce BRL-CAD.

	* HACKING:
	heh, around means immediately inside -- go figure.  give a couple more 
examples while we're at it.

	* HACKING:
	finish up the list of expectations with a rule zero utilizing a concept 
from Hippocrates' Epidemics: contributors are expected to help, or at least to 
do no harm.

	* AUTHORS:
	add James (swcto - someone who cares) to the list of code contributors 
for his work on the mged vi mode enhancements

2006-06-23  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/grid.c:
	Improved algorithm for deciding when to not draw the grid. Now compares 
pixel size to
	grid spacing instead of calculating number of dots.

2006-06-22  johnranderson  <johnranderson@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/grid.c: Fix for bug #1233930 (grid zoom out hangs)
	Problem was integer overflow.
	Fix was to check for negative integer. A better algorithm for deciding 
when
	the grid should not be drawn is needed here.

2006-06-22  brlcad  <brlcad@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/Makefile.am:
	additional testing files that need to get cleaned up

	* src/rt/do.c:
	check and see if the eye point was set to something different than the 
look at point, otherwise choose a default 'front' view just to pick a 
direction.  also, make sure rtip is valid before checking lists

	* src/rt/opt.c:
	initialize a slew of uninitialized values using proper casts for the 
fastf_t types.  uninitialized garbage was causing debug and runtime problems on 
altix

	* NEWS: ported jove to SGI Altix platform, fixed crash bug.

	* src/other/jove/jove_term.c:
	prevent jove from crashing on SGI Altix due to clamping the tgetstr 
pointer to 32-bit when it needs to be 64-bit.  this requires actually including 
the right headers so that tgetstr is properly declared, but declare it to what 
it should be regardless since.. this is jove.

	* NEWS:
	increase default mged line scrollback to 10,000 lines instead of the 
previous 1000.. too many commands and listings fill up the 1000 count.  users 
can still override that default on the fly in their .mgedrc or on the command 
line.

	* src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	set the default number of scrollback lines in mged to 10k instead of 1k

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	prevent a bus error if read() returns -1 when reading from the provided 
file descriptor

	* NEWS: improved support for Mac 'delete' keys in mged

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	add support for the Mac delete key (backwards and forwards should work 
now).  also fix vi command line editing mode history, quell warnings, pass null 
parameter.

	* NEWS: james made it command edit history searching

	* NEWS, src/mged/ged.c, src/mged/history.c, 
src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/text.tcl:
	bigger, better vi command line editing in mged provided by james 
(swcto).  this adds command history searching as well as pretty much full 
vi-mode command editing.  (sf patch 1377410 - Bigger, Better vi command line 
editing)

	* NEWS: rt command script 'ae' no longer resets view scale

	* src/rt/do.c:
	gah, don't reset the view scale.. it might have been specifically set 
to something else.  instead call do_ae() now instead of waiting for end.  this 
still doesn't work right as do_ae does its own autoview on the geometry and 
resizes, but at least ae command doesn't override now

	* src/libbu/bitv.c: ws

	* src/conv/asc-nmg.1:
	fixed asc-nmg manual page usage examples, it doesn't take stdin and 
output to stdout, but if you provide both file names it works (it will take 
stdin, but then you can't specify output file)

	* NEWS: fixed asc-nmg manual page usage examples

	* BUGS:
	usage of lt says 'lt object'  yet if you actually type that  you get a 
bus error.. nice.

	* src/other/jove/Makefile.am:
	ACK, typo.. DESDIR != DESTDIR, fix sandbox error
