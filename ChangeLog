	  harder/sooner after. still, lots of great awesome.

2012-06-23 17:32  crdueck

	* [r51300] src/libged/analyze.c:

2012-06-23 17:18  starseeker

	* [r51299] CMakeLists.txt:
	  Remove what look like stray leftover lines - distclean is handled
	  with cmake script files now.

2012-06-23 06:10  crdueck

	* [r51298] src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8.c:
	  restructured rt_arb_get_cgtype(): simplified code using better
	  vector macros, changed logic for storing duplicate points, lots
	  of ws changes

	  This was causing the frame buffer to not display correctly.
	  Improved logic to ignore a selection box with zero area. Changed
	  the output of the contents of the selection box to list on a
	  single line. This change was to make easier copying and pasting
	  of this list. Improved status messages while grouper is
	  processing.

2012-06-21 12:15  bob1961

	* [r51273] src/libged/wdb_obj.c:
	  MGED dumps core when trying to pick an edit primitive from the
	  display when nothing is displayed. The problem was in
	  wdb_rt_gettrees_cmd(). We need to keep checking argc since it's
	  being decremented as we process args. Also modified wdb_cmd()
	  ===> needed to pass a pointer to ret in the call to bu_cmd so we
	  get the correct return value.

	* [r51168] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  This fixes some of the issues that were encountered using the
	  rtwizard interface in Archer. The fix was to compute the eye_pt
	  (i.e. a call to get_eyemodel computes this) whenever the display
	  changes and convert it to view coordinates before comparing to
	  the mSavedViewEyePt. The eye_pt with the largest Z value wins.
	  This value, if set, is used to override libged/rtwizard.c.

	  getting adjusted unless the view center was inside the bounding
	  box of the displayed solids. This breaks depending on the view.
	  If not zclipping the eye_model is now always getting adjusted.
	  The second problem was that the eye_model was getting adjusted by
	  the extent of the bounding box diagonal alone. We also need to
	  consider how far away the center of displayed geometry is from
	  the view center.

	  an extra buffer is needed in that case to handle the line input
	  versus the sscan buffer for reading tokens (but I didn't try

	* [r50763] src/libbu/test_vls_vprintf.c, src/libbu/vls_internals.h,
	  src/libbu/vls_vprintf.c:
	  This is a major change to vsl_vprintf (and related files)
	  incorporating a more modular approach. In general, this change
	  tries
	  to separate the parsing of the format string from the handling of
	  the
	  result, both for valid as well as for obsolete or unknown parts.
	  The
	  approach is also intended to ease maintenance and future
	  enhancements.

	  The function specification has also been modified somewhat.

	  More specifically:

	  src/libbu/vls_internals.h
	  =========================

	  + make VP_* bit flags available for multiple files
	  + expand the set of VP_* bit flags
	  + make the vflags_t type available for multiple files
	  + make three of the vls_vprintf helper functions available for
	  multiple files

	  src/libbu/test_vls_vprintf.c
	  ============================

	  + add new test function 'check_format_chars' to ensure consistent
	  coverage of the defined valid and obsolete format characaters

	  src/libbu/vls_vprintf.c
	  =======================

	  + hoist the vflags_t definition into vls_internals.h for use by
	  the
	  regression test (test_vls_vprinf.c)

	  + move functions

	  + consolidate vls_printf helper functions into four:

	  - format_part_status: uses bit flags to define, for each
	  character,
	  what category it's in and whether it's valid, obsolete, or
	  unknown

	  - handle_obsolete_format_char: contains helper info messages for
	  the
	  user of obsolete chars

	  - reset flags: resets an instance of the vflags_t to known values

	  - handle_format_part: consolidates handling of the different
	  categories of valid format characters; only turned on at the
	  moment for
	  length modifier type

	  + use the new 'handle_format_part' function to hoist handling of
	  the
	  length modifiers (LMs) out of the format parsing loop

	  + add the formerly implicit handling of the 'c' conversion
	  specifier (CS)
	  to the CS handling section

	  + consolidate CS error handling in the default section of the CS
	  switch statement

	  + do some ws and style tidying

	  Future changes planned
	  ======================

	  + turn on modular handling of other categories of format chars

	  + incorporate modular handling of compiler oddities such as the
	  'z'
	  length modifier for Visual Studio C

	  directly make use of umask, the temporary files staged in the
	  build directory do. The install process in turn makes use of the
	  permissions set on those files. It does not appear to be possible
	  to set umask from the CMake build itself, so instead warnings are
	  generated if the umask setting looks problematic.

	  icv_image_save_open is already called by do.c:795, resulting in a

	  again. Difference looks to be ICV_IMAGE_AUTO_NO_PIX vs
	  ICV_IMAGE_AUTO between the two calls - looking at
	  fileformat.c:278 the only difference is the icv_image_save_open
	  command will not default to returning a pix file if it doesn't
	  recognize the image format via extension. Unless there is a good
	  reason for rtedge to be a special case, this behavior should
	  probably be consistent across the rt commands one way or the
	  other.

	  Investigating off-by-many errors in the solids regression test,

	  viewscripts differed in the last/15th place after the decimal
	  point. Cliff observed calculations from cos() differing on the
	  16th digit prior to being written out, undoubtedly due to subtle
	  implementation differences (round vs truncate) as "real" value
	  was nearly halfway between cos() values being calculated for
	  Linux and Mac. Double-precision IEEE floating point only
	  guarantees 15-17 digits of precision, depending on the
	  calculation, so using a .15 precision specifier makes our printed
	  value dip into unreliable territory (1+15 significant digits). By
	  pulling the value up to .14, we get 15 digits of precision,
	  identical view scripts, and the solids test passes without
	  differences. Looking through our history, this seems to be safe
	  as the value prior to printing quaternions was %.9e. Anything
	  from 9->14 should be safe.

	  Updated files 'CMakeLists.txt' and 'Makefile.am' to add the tcl

	* [r50402] CMakeLists.txt, misc/CMake/distcheck_autotools.cmake.in:
	  This looks like it might be a viable way of regularly checking
	  the Autotools distcheck target (at least to the extent of making
	  sure it doesn't error out). Right now it looks like trunk
	  Autotools distcheck is not happy, so this breaks distcheck-full
	  until that gets sorted out.

	* [r50401] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  per IRC discussion in the aftermath of an autotools removal
	  revert, tighten up the deprecation language to specify two minor
	  release needing to include the deprecation notice. include an
	  example so it's even more explicit and not subject to
	  intepretation. strictly speaking, this reduces our deprecation
	  window by a minor but makes the policy about as tight as it can
	  get without being reckless or non-existent.

	  all flags to all targets, but libged's polycurve.cpp triggered a
	  build error with clang (and had been warning with gcc) when the
	  std=gnu99 flag got applied. Only a problem with libged currently,
	  but potentially could apply to any mixed C/C++ library. Approach
	  now is more granular - can define C and CXX variables
	  independently to pass up, and BRLCAD_ADDLIB will only apply C
	  flags to C files and CXX flags to C++ files.

2012-04-24 09:50  brlcad

	  take crazy measures to make it clear we're sanitizing the

2012-04-24 06:07  brlcad

	* [r50217] src/librt/db_tree.c:

2012-04-24 04:47  brlcad

	* [r50206] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  if the database is fresh, we have to build the directory before

	* [r50191] CMakeLists.txt, misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Targets.cmake:
	  Couple tweaks for the subbuild case - need to make sure we avoid
	  names like liblibbu, and distcheck is disabled when we're a
	  subbuild.

	  Start teaching rtwizard to take inputs from the command line
	  (will provide a way to avoid the need for graphically picking
	  components, and eventually will allow for complete non-graphical
	  rtwizard image generation - useful for regression testing.) At
	  this stage, should just preserve old behavior.

2012-04-18 11:41  indianlarry

	* [r50167] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.h:
	  Commented out early bail out of BREP bounding-box intersect
	  routine to also include bounding-boxes behind the ray origin.
	  Lets the calling application handle cases where ray starts inside
	  of a solid. We were getting an odd number of hits when rays were
	  being started on the backside but just inside of an existing
	  component messing up the segment in/out logic. Could have
	  injected an "in hit" at the ray origin but most solids would have
	  returned the calculated "in hit" at a negative distance from the
	  origin.

2012-04-18 11:28  erikgreenwald

	* [r50166] src/librt/primitives/bot/btg.c:

	  non-normalized direction vectors.

	* [r50165] src/util/loop.c:

2012-04-18 11:06  indianlarry

	* [r50164] src/librt/primitives/bot/btg.c:
	  BOT hits were disappearing from the segment when using TIE. TIE
	  was determining correct hits on tri's but was losing these when
	  creating the hit segments in rt_bot_makesegs_(). The
	  rt_bot_makesegs_() function uses the hit_vpriv[] from the hit
	  structure to clean up odd hits, exit before entrance, or dangling
	  entrance hits but this was not being set in TIE. Added code in
	  TIE hitfunc() to populate these variables similar to what is done
	  in non-TIE BOT code.

2012-04-17 20:45  brlcad

	* [r50147] src/libged/vdraw.c:
	  do the same to the non-wdb version of vdraw. note that this looks
	  like it was a bonefide vlist off-by-one issue since it was
	  shifting cmd values down from +1 and +1 could exceed
	  BN_VLIST_CHUNK. perhaps related to some of the wireframe
	  instability.

2012-04-17 20:39  brlcad

	  fails. just assume rewind worked and scan from position 0.

2012-04-17 18:13  brlcad

	* [r50139] src/util/sun-pix.c:
	  looks like cid 332 is caused by use of unsigned long instead of
	  the implicit uint32_t type it's using it as. change getlong() to
	  return 32-bit type so we hopefully avoid all truncation

	  many coverity is detecting.

2012-04-17 17:36  brlcad

	* [r50136] src/conv/ply-g.c:
	  already quelled cid 325 (integer_overflow), but can we fake it
	  out? it's not an integer, so maybe using a double temp might make
	  that clear.

2012-04-17 17:20  brlcad

	* [r50135] include/raytrace.h, src/librt/db5_io.c:
	  change some of the sanity/bounds checks during object reads to
	  ensure we don't overflow/underflow (cid 322). change
	  db5_decode_length() to return a size_t since the value is always
	  a sizeof size.

	* [r50133] src/rt/rtexample.c:
	  initialize cur with RT_CURVATURE_INIT_ZERO - hopefully will
	  address CID 1615

2012-04-17 16:39  brlcad

	* [r50132] src/librt/search.c:
	  vastly simplify the logic by just checking what we need
	  piecewise. reduces about 50 lines to 15. hopefully addresses the
	  deadcode condition being reported in cid 212 due to the
	  now-singular path through the if/else cases.

2012-04-17 16:20  brlcad

	* [r50131] src/irprep/secpass.c:

2012-04-17 16:11  brlcad

	* [r50130] src/irprep/secpass.c:
	  join the second typeout comparison with an if/else since both

2012-04-17 16:06  brlcad

	* [r50128] src/librt/shoot.c:
	  yet another attempt at quelling cid 98, array_vs_singleton. since

	  before blindly using it for cutp iteration.

2012-04-17 14:36  starseeker

	  more bounds checking

2012-04-17 07:43  brlcad

2012-04-17 06:56  brlcad

	* [r50119] src/irprep/irdisp.c:

	  make my old code match current project style conventions

2012-04-17 02:17  brlcad

	* [r50103] include/bu.h:
	  if we cast the pointer and the head pointer, we will avoid a
	  pointer-type mismatch if someone happens to use a non bu_list
	  type. arguably an error, but there's nothing that technically
	  requires the head pointer actually be a bu_list struct. that
	  change lets us fix BU_LIST_FOR_CIRC() which was being used in nmg
	  code with non-bu types.

2012-04-17 01:51  brlcad

	* [r50102] src/librt/vshoot.c:
	  make sure HeadSeg isn't null before we go dereferencing it to
	  free segments. can't push the check up into RT_FREE_SEG_LIST()
	  because not all list heads are pointers (which would provoke a
	  warning that a check is always true). fixes a coverity
	  forward_null defect, cid 308.

	* [r50097] src/librt/primitives/extrude/extrude.c:

	* [r50095] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_inter.c:
	  check fu1 and fu2 for null to quell CID 249. false-positive, but
	  good to handle make explicit anyways.

	  pointer.

	  changing all references to function 'db_tree_funcleaf' to include

	* [r50091] src/conv/iges/g-iges.c:

2012-04-16 21:27  r_weiss

	* [r50090] include/raytrace.h:

	  src/libged/showmats.c, src/libged/trace.c, src/libged/wcodes.c,

	  Updated files xpush.c list.c copyeval.c showmats.c find.c
	  pathsum.c wcodes.c wdb_obj.c trace.c ged_private.h push.c
	  get_obj_bounds.c prefix.c and edcodes.c within the libged
	  library. Changed functions 'ged_list' (ie mged 'l' command,
	  lowercase L) and ged_pathsum (ie mged 'paths' command) to accept
	  an addition parameter '-t' meaning terse to reduce the amount of
	  information displayed when using these commands. This is useful
	  when you want to use the 'l' command on a very large bot and do
	  not want to see all full listing of millions of vertices and
	  faces. Within function 'ged_pathsum' removed the call to clear
	  'ged_result_str' since in some cases we want to keep the
	  information already in this string when entering this function.
	  We just want to append to the 'ged_result_str'. Also initialized
	  the '_ged_trace_data' structure as a sanity check. Fixed a
	  seg-fault then the pattern string is just '/'.

2012-04-16 21:18  tbrowder2

2012-04-16 15:55  brlcad

	* [r50084] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_misc.c:
	  make sure when duplicating a shell that we don't assume a face
	  has a loop (crash). detected by coverity forward_null cid 244.

2012-04-16 15:46  brlcad

	* [r50083] src/libbu/bitv.c:
	  prevent a null dereference if we pass a null bitvector around.
	  however, return an empty bitvector from new() so we never
	  propagate a null. should fix coverity forward_null cid 242.

2012-04-16 15:37  brlcad

	* [r50082] src/mged/tedit.c:
	  editor is set to jove as a fallback so it can't be null. just use

2012-04-16 15:13  brlcad

	* [r50081] src/mged/share.c:
	  prevent a deadcode condition detected by coverity by only calling
	  SHARE_RESOURCE once outside the uflag if/else conditional. cid

2012-04-16 15:02  brlcad

	* [r50080] src/mged/share.c:
	  ws indent cleanup now that there are semicolons

2012-04-16 15:01  brlcad

	* [r50079] src/mged/share.c:
	  turn SHARE_RESOURCE macro into a do/while loop so we can always
	  include a trailing semicolon so code looks like valid code.

2012-04-16 14:56  brlcad

	* [r50078] src/mged/polyif.c:
	  since the original implementation commit in 1991, manually
	  calculating normals for export has been disabled, so remove the
	  code for it. fixes the deadcode issue reported in cid 218.

2012-04-16 14:47  brlcad

	* [r50077] src/mged/chgview.c:
	  quell a deadcode defect detected by coverity (cid 217) by
	  cleaning up the logic to match the messages being printed. if it
	  introduces a bug, then the message being printed is
	  wrong/misleading.

2012-04-16 14:36  brlcad

	* [r50076] src/mged/animedit.c:
	  looks like coverity deadcode defect CID 214 is a false positive,
	  complaining about curfound being always true, but try to be
	  explicit anyways for code clarity. move the initial false case
	  init out to the loop so it's clear that it starts false.

2012-04-16 14:20  brlcad

	* [r50075] src/mged/animedit.c:
	  accfound is never set to true, so conditional is always true.
	  eliminate the var, even though it looks like it implies bad
	  logic..

2012-04-16 13:35  brlcad

	* [r50074] src/librt/opennurbs_ext.h,
	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp,
	  src/librt/primitives/brep/brep_debug.cpp:
	  looks like BVNode<BV>::isTrimmed() is trying to set a pointer, so
	  we need a pointer to it for it to persist back to the caller.
	  this fixes a deadcode condition detected by coverity (CID 209),
	  which looks like a bonefide bug in the trimming code where it was
	  keeping track of an adjacent trimmed face id (where it would
	  always get set to -99).

2012-04-16 05:44  brlcad

	* [r50070] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:

2012-04-16 05:37  brlcad

	* [r50069] src/liborle/rle.c:
	  unlikely to fix cid 405 (OVERRUN_STATIC), but it looks like false
	  positive. simplify the pointer a bit to see if it has an effect
	  on the detected defect.

2012-04-16 05:26  brlcad

2012-04-16 05:01  brlcad

	* [r50067] src/libged/wdb_obj.c:
	  fix three different deadcode coverity detections (cid 205, 206,
	  207), two of which are obvious, but the third not so much.. it
	  looks like the arb8 block was completely replicated but not kept
	  in sync. remove the seemingly weaker second version matching the
	  non-wdb_obj version.

2012-04-16 04:38  brlcad

	* [r50066] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_misc.c:
	  little tricky to see it, but coverity seems to have correctly
	  identified a deadcode condition where the loop never iterated
	  more than once (found_face gets set to true on first pass). cid
	  175. converted to an if-clause in order to preserve existing
	  behavior while allowing for code simplification.

2012-04-16 04:06  brlcad

	* [r50065] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_misc.c:
	  quell dead code issue for the always-false block by commenting it

	* [r50063] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_class.c:
	  convert the goto retry logic into a do/while loop. this is in

	  code resulting in the original head node getting incremented. fix
	  is to make sure we're not incrementing what we started with
	  (since if it's a nugrid node, it should have been set to
	  soemthing else on the first pass).

	* [r49960] NEWS:
	  The original problem was a result of the getint and getdouble
	  functions using the actual field input size when parsing an input
	  line
	  and the bu_strlcpy macros in those two functions promptly chopped
	  off
	  the last character as they are supposed to do. I replaced the
	  macros
	  with the bu_vls_strncpy functions so the parsing is more
	  intuitive in
	  that actual field size is entered and the last character is not
	  chopped

	  The problem prevented successful conversion on any input deck,
	  and
	  with the fix it now works on a complex TGM input file.

	  A successful round trip was also made with the same TGM. Note
	  that
	  "success" is within the constraints of the vdeck <-=> comgeom-g
	  converters where the solid, region, and group names are used
	  differently so one has to track the objects carefully to ensure
	  the
	  trip was made correctly.

2012-03-27 15:24  d_rossberg

	* [r49820] src/other/openNURBS/CMakeLists.txt:
	  fixed the test if zlib was really build locally: variable has
	  changed to BRLCAD_ZLIB_BUILD

2012-03-27 03:23  starseeker

	* [r49819] CMakeLists.txt:
	  Add the appropriate lines for the Ninja generator

2012-03-26 20:35  jordisayol

	* [r49817] misc/debian/rules:
	  disable strip on deb package building

2012-03-26 20:07  starseeker

	* [r49816] src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Ah hah! SCL interfering by CACHE FORCE of the build type - dodge
	  the issue by telling SCL to use whatever build type we've set,
	  but still - need to fix the SCL approach

2012-03-26 19:52  r_weiss

	* [r49815] src/tclscripts/mged/grouper.tcl:
	  Updated TCL script 'grouper.tcl' for MGED commands 'gr',
	  'grouper', 'dg' and 'done_grouper'. Added ability to select
	  primitives either partially or completely within the selection
	  box. Added documentation and did code cleanup.

2012-03-26 19:43  starseeker

	* [r49814] misc/CMake/CompilerFlags.cmake:
	  Use both g and ggdb3, if available

2012-03-26 09:26  jordisayol

	* [r49812] misc/debian/rules, sh/make_rpm.sh:
	  update cmake optimization argument for deb/rpm building

2012-03-24 16:33  jordisayol

	* [r49811] misc/debian/rules, sh/make_rpm.sh:
	  update cmake arguments for deb/rpm building

2012-03-23 22:48  brlcad

	* [r49810] include/bselect.h:
	  the __extension__ keyword does not exist in gcc 4.1 and given the
	  FD_SET() warning (so far) only affects gcc 4.6, make the
	  work-around very unfeature specific. this is only kosher given
	  this is a b*.h system header wrapper, which aren't supposed to
	  use cmake/configure feature test results. this fixes an obscure
	  build failure that was being observed on older systems that
	  failed in backtrace.c with an error: expected expression before
	  'asm'

2012-03-23 21:17  bob1961

	* [r49809] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Tweak ArcherCore::compSelectGroupAdd, compSelectGroupRemove and
	  compSelectGroupCommon a bit.

2012-03-23 21:00  r_weiss

	* [r49808] src/mged/setup.c:
	  Updated file 'setup.c' for mged. Added the ability to use the
	  libged function 'ged_select' from mged.

2012-03-23 20:58  r_weiss

	* [r49807] src/tclscripts/mged/grouper.tcl:
	  Updated to TCL script 'grouper.tcl' commands 'gr' and 'dg'. To
	  improve performance, changed logic to use libged function
	  'ged_select'. Also script now highlights in yellow objects in the
	  current group.

2012-03-23 18:34  bob1961

	* [r49806] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Use COMP_SELECT_MODE_NAMES throughout the GUI.

2012-03-23 17:40  bob1961

	* [r49805] src/libged/erase.c:
	  Modified libged/erase.c/eraseAllSubpathsFromSolidList() to remove
	  display lists only when the corresponding solid is removed from
	  the display.

2012-03-23 17:04  bob1961

	* [r49804] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added more selection modes (i.e. "List (Partial)", "Group Add
	  (Partial)" and "Group Remove (Partial)".

2012-03-23 17:01  bob1961

	* [r49803] src/tclscripts/lib/Ged.tcl:
	  Mods to support selecting components even if only partially
	  contained within the specified area.

2012-03-23 14:20  bob1961

	* [r49802] src/libged/select.c:
	  Modified the select and rselect commands to optionally select
	  components that are partially contained in the specified area.

2012-03-22 21:53  bob1961

	* [r49801] src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Modified ArcherCore::initCompSelect to call doSelectGroup if not
	  in COMP_SELECT_LIST_MODE

2012-03-22 21:38  bob1961

	* [r49800] src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Extended the component selection mechanism to have more than one
	  mode. A mode was added to add components to a group. Another mode
	  was added to remove components from a group. Currently, the
	  components being referred to here are expected to be primitives,
	  so this behaves like MGED'S grouper.

	* [r49799] src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/other/step/src/fedex_plus/fedex_idl.c:
	  remove fedex_idl program; removed from mpictor git repo in
	  dbbf4b9

2012-03-22 18:59  starseeker

	* [r49798] CMakeLists.txt:
	  It's rare to want any configuration besided BUNDLED with MSVC,
	  and the time overhead of a second configure step on Windows can
	  be quite high - go with BUNDLED for the default on MSVC

2012-03-22 18:52  n_reed

	* [r49797] src/other/step/src/express/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/other/step/src/express/symlink.c:

	* [r49796] src/other/step.dist:
	  whoops, ignoring non-existant file

2012-03-22 18:04  starseeker

	* [r49795] src/other/CMakeLists.txt, src/other/step/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/other/step/cmake/scl_version_string.cmake:
	  don't use a generic IS_SUBBUILD variable - bad idea.

	  generated by running fedex_plus on the Ed 2 header schema
	  (http://www.steptools.com/sc4/archive/imp-methods/10303-21-header.exp).

	* [r49782] src/librt/primitives/brep/brep.cpp:
	  The brep intersect routine was only looking forward of the ray
	  origin so modified to include both positive and negative hit
	  distances along the shotline(The calling rt application decides
	  what to do with hits behind the ray origin). Also now storing
	  'dist' in the 'brep_hit' class to keep from recalculating
	  distance for hit ordering(change original brep_hit constructor to
	  now take an 'rt_ray', also added new constructor that also takes
	  'dist'). This fixes error found during VL comparison to BOTS when
	  generating spall.

	  src/other/re2c/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/other/step/CMake/FindLEMON.cmake,
	  src/other/step/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Nevermind the LoadMacros hack - just prevent the re2c/lemon macro
	  definitions from being overwritten if they're already defined
	  using Alexander Neundorf's tip from
	  http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2008-February/019776.html.
	  BRL-CAD defines 'em first, so the src/other copies won't get
	  loaded (makes sure older versions of macro files that might
	  linger in src/other don't stomp misc/CMake versions) but
	  stand-alone builds will use the local copies. Properly set up
	  search ordering with CMAKE_MODULE_PATH should take care of this
	  for the find_package commands, but the utility macros are
	  separate and so must be handled differently.

	  Install instructions at the end of builddelta need to be aware of
	  what was used to build BRL-CAD - 'make install' won't do very
	  much when you are using xcodebuild, for example.

	* [r49747] CMakeLists.txt,
	  misc/CMake/multiconfig_path_clean.cmake.in,
	  misc/CMake/multiconfig_path_read.cmake.in:
	  Problem with MGED not being able to work with the version
	  variable was due to brlcad_ident output containing the variable
	  path - apparently Tcl didn't like the dollar-sign and curly
	  brackets. Seeing as that's also not the right path if someone
	  does do an install, teach BRL-CAD how to get the actual path
	  corresponding to a particular configuration in the case where the
	  installation path is based on the build configuration. Could have
	  punted and required a fixed path for all configurations, but this
	  lets make install tests for different configs proceed without
	  stomping each other.

	  loosely based off a snippet from Jack Kelly on the cmake mailing
	  list except it avoids writing out a source file and only defines
	  inline to something else if we need to. alas, this implementation
	  does cop-out and sets a global definition instead of letting the
	  caller decide by passing in a variable, but it should work well
	  enough for those legacy systems and compilation modes (like
	  default icc compilation) that need it.

2012-02-16 08:04  starseeker

	* [r49448] misc/CMake/Distcheck.cmake,
	  misc/CMake/distcheck_repo_verify.cmake.in,
	  misc/CMake/distcheck_target.cmake.in:
	  'Anything worth doing is worth applying insane overengineering
	  to, or something like that... This takes the CMake distcheck
	  architecture to the next level. It modularizes the distcheck
	  process into repository verification, source generation, and
	  build/regress testing components, with appropriate dependencies.
	  In addition to the advantage of being able to run 'only what you
	  need' if, say, you want to check repo verification status this
	  actually makes distribution testing of multiple build/configure
	  settings independent. So if distcheck needs to test both Debug
	  and Release CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE settings (which looks like a good
	  idea) a make -j9 distcheck will do the repo verifiction, build
	  the source archives and launch multiple builds of BRL-CAD in
	  parallel. On massively parallel machines this means not only C
	  source compilations in parallel but multiple CMake configures
	  running in parallel as well. The logging by default is much
	  quieter now, althought there is a variable override if needed...
	  to monitor the progress of individual configurations' builds you
	  can now tail -f the distcheck_<type>.log files in the build
	  directory - so even for parallel testing of multiple
	  configurations the logging is organized automatically. The
	  standard distcheck target will do Debug and Release, but there is
	  also a distcheck-full target that will run ALL defined
	  configurations. Right now there aren't any more, but there are
	  some obvious candiates like a non-Tk build, and they can be added
	  to distcheck-full with a single definition line in
	  Distcheck.cmake

	  to strlcpy() for platforms that don't provide it.

	  Thank you Windows for tremendously complicating life. The
	  add_library command puts out two files on Windows - a .dll and a
	  .lib - the dll goes into the executable directory and the lib
	  goes in the library directory. That means on Windows and only on
	  Windows, the pkgIndex.tcl scripts are going to have to know to
	  look in a different path. This was hidden earlier by setting
	  LIB_DIR to bin, but since we don't want to do that any more we
	  can no longer ignore the problem. Will take a fair bit of work to
	  get this right - all the src/other logic dealing with Tcl will

2012-02-07 09:07  brlcad

	* [r49299] src/librt/comb/db_comb.c:
	  rewicker logic to avoid strncpy()/strncat() altogether. it's a
	  memory buffer being read from, so just call memcpy. also, there
	  was no apparent reason for a buffer size of 94, so increase it to
	  an 'even' 128. this is nearly double what is needed (32+32+2) so
	  there should be plenty of nul termination trailing.

2012-02-07 09:02  brlcad

	* [r49298] regress/repository.sh:

	* [r49294] src/libged/red.c:
	  looks like the code merely got lucky before if the edit name got

	  INSTALL.new on CMake is different because we're not running the
	  THIRD_PARTY macro for SCL on Windows. Try a different approach to
	  disabling SCL with MSVC that should let the THIRD_PARTY macro
	  run. This will be moot once we get SCL working with MSVC, and can
	  go away then.

	  this improves memory management as well eliminating the function
	  call and memory allocation should the vls not actually be needed;
	  and it eliminates a memory leak if a vls were initialized but not
	  freed during an error condition. overall, improved
	  maintainability.

	  issue caused by trying to serialize a 64-bit value into 32-bits

	  dimension parameters to size_t didn't account for them being
	  converted typeless via libbu's bu_vls_struct_print('%d') during
	  export via int coercion into 32-bit data. thus, 64-bit size_t's
	  on a big-endian platform were writing out as zero (unless they
	  happened to have a value that exceeded 32-bits) which ends up

2012-01-24 07:38  brlcad

	* [r49019] src/bwish/input.c:
	  more of the same, even identical code to mged, assumptions of

	  explicit copy regardless of the need to preserve behavior until
	  more direct testing can occur.

2012-01-24 07:22  brlcad

	* [r49017] src/mged/mged.c:
	  handle a slew of '%*s' bu_loggers that seemed to assume strncpy
	  behavior with the size being a max (it's a min). probably all
	  benign (possibly even unnecessary code) given they all merely
	  blank out some portion of the input prompt, but preserves
	  behavior until more extensive testing can occur.

2012-01-24 07:04  brlcad

	* [r49016] NEWS:
	  improved tab-completion behavior for mged and archer. now once
	  you have a match, it will auto-append a space after the command
	  so you're ready for the next argument. also, hitting tab on an
	  empty line will return all registered commands instead of
	  silently doing nothing. untested for archer (non-gui atm)

2012-01-24 06:12  brlcad

	* [r49015] src/tclscripts/lib/Command.tcl:
	  apply similar usability enhancement to archer as was done for

2012-01-24 06:06  brlcad

	* [r49014] src/tclscripts/lib/Command.tcl:
	  do the same for archer. looks like entirely duplicate code

2012-01-23 02:16  tbrowder2

	* [r48962] src/libbu/vls.c:
	  Fixed so no current regression tests fail (but no guarantees).
	  Found some missing flags, precision wasn't handled properly

	  width]).
	  Added new bit flags for special format cases, added FIXMEs where
	  more looks are needed (more tests need to be added).
	  Added bit flag categories of modifiers and category bit-clearing
	  flags
	  Added comments to help trace the control flow.
	  Added curly braces to help decode and clarify if/else paths.
	  Added provision for "expected fail" cases (none at the moment).
	  Tests need to be added to handle more cases.
	  Review and critique solicited.

	* [r48961] src/libbu/test_vls.c:

	  failures
	  to the exit code.
	  Modified format of test_vls function to more readily see the
	  input
	  being tested.
	  Added some printf statements to help explain test output.

	  fixing bu_fchmod() to be an fchmod() signature-matching function
	  was a good and sufficient fix. don't really need two functions

	  windows via _fileno())

	* [r48943] misc/CMake/ThirdParty.cmake:

	  start to tidy analyze output formatting: add some global values
	  and subroutines for handling dynamic table creation

2012-01-18 23:41  starseeker

	* [r48899] doc/docbook/resources/other/fonts/y14.5.tar.bz2,
	  doc/docbook/resources/other/fonts/y14.5_COPYING:
	  Add public domain geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (gdt)
	  fonts from Peter Kanold, with an eye towards their being useful
	  in the new annotation primitive.

	* [r48898] include/rtgeom.h:
	  Will need some way to specify head styles for points in
	  leaders...

	* [r48897] include/db5.h, include/magic.h, include/raytrace.h,
	  include/rtgeom.h:
	  Start working out how to represent annotations in librt. Mostly
	  just initial thought, defining magic, etc.

	* [r48896] CMakeLists.txt, include/bu.h, src/libbu/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/sscanf.c,
	  src/libbu/test_sscanf.c:
	  Add bu_sscanf and bu_vsscanf routines and associated test
	  program. Just wrappers for now; won't build without C99 vsscanf
	  routine.

	* [r48895] src/tclscripts/archer/AttrGroupsDisplayUtility.tcl:
	  wrap the open for read statements with a catch

	* [r48894] include/bu.h, include/config_win.h,
	  include/config_win_cmake.h.in, src/fb/fb-pix.c, src/fb/fb-png.c,
	  src/libbu/fchmod.c, src/libbu/file.c, src/libbu/parallel.c,
	  src/libged/fb2pix.c, src/libged/saveview.c, src/rt/do.c:
	  - removed the wrong fchmod() <--> chmod() correspondence in
	  Windows (sorry for this)
	  - changed the bu_fchmod() parameter from stream to descriptor (as
	  in fchmod()) and created a new bu_fchmod_stream() with stream
	  parameter (i.e. same behavior as the old bu_fchmod())
	  => bu_fchmod() should be an adequate wrapper (if fchmod() is
	  present) or replacement for fchmod() by now (I hope)

	* [r48893] NEWS, TODO, src/other/libpng.dist:
	  Upgraded libpng to 1.5.7 - hopefully this will address issues on
	  ppc64, but it also means we should be able to use the vanilla
	  CMakeLists.txt file, since our changes were incorporated
	  upstream. Re-applied Makefile.am changes.

2012-01-18 02:41  starseeker

	* [r48892] src/other/libpng/Makefile.am:

	* [r48889] src/libged/analyze.c:
	  starting on cleaning up analyze table formatting; some ws and
	  style fixes, too

2012-01-17 19:40  brlcad

	* [r48888] TODO:
	  Apparently the latest libpng might resovle the ld failure
	  encountered on FC16, ppc64.

2012-01-17 17:45  tbrowder2

	* [r48887] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  improve comment; realign code with correct spacing after edits

2012-01-17 16:28  d_rossberg

	* [r48886] src/libbu/timer.c:
	  there is no preprocessor directive #warning in MSVC 2008
	  there is an equivalent preprocessor directive but then we need an
	  additional compiler switch ...

2012-01-17 16:20  d_rossberg

	* [r48885] include/config_win.h, include/config_win_cmake.h.in:
	  two additional Windows symbol equivalences (fchmod(), mode_t)

2012-01-17 15:54  tbrowder2

	* [r48884] regress/weight.sh:
	  modify test 2 output to reflect removal of all comments from the
	  density file before further processing

2012-01-17 15:53  tbrowder2

	* [r48883] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  remove comments before further processing of an input line

2012-01-17 15:31  tbrowder2

	* [r48882] regress/weight.sh:
	  add another bit of complexity to the second test (inline
	  comments)--current trunk still passes this test

2012-01-17 12:51  tbrowder2

	* [r48881] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  oops, free resources at the right place

2012-01-17 12:42  tbrowder2

	* [r48880] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  realign std spaces after editing; add some FIX ME notes and
	  questions for more experienced heads; free resources

2012-01-17 00:24  tbrowder2

	* [r48879] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  a slight optimization

2012-01-16 23:26  tbrowder2

	* [r48878] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  give more info on missing material info--name the region affected

2012-01-16 22:08  tbrowder2

	* [r48877] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  moved WEIGHT BY REGION NAME outside the first region collection
	  loop, then used
	  the new array on the print out
	  ran the current regression test (./regress/weight.sh) 100 times
	  with NO
	  failures
	  next step will be a bit of optimization on the inner read loop of
	  the
	  two main print loops

2012-01-16 21:45  tbrowder2

	* [r48876] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  removed macro guards
	  moved second block ["if (rpt_overlap)"] into the first
	  rearrange some block variables as a result
	  fill new region array
	  increment MAX_ITEM by 2 to create an "end ID" for conventional
	  loop idiom use
	  use new array for WEIGHT BY REGION ID sort
	  use new id variable to emphasize index on region ID

2012-01-16 20:32  tbrowder2

	* [r48875] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  oops, forgot to replace integer with the variable name

2012-01-16 20:29  tbrowder2

	* [r48874] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  use variables instead of error-prone integer literals to define
	  format field widths

2012-01-16 20:22  tbrowder2

	* [r48873] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  remove 'always true test'

	* [r48872] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  turn off array version for now

2012-01-16 20:19  tbrowder2

	* [r48871] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  add macro guards to maintain two versions during development

2012-01-16 20:17  tbrowder2

	* [r48870] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  add variables for a region array

2012-01-16 20:15  tbrowder2

	* [r48869] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  add a qsort comp function for future use

2012-01-16 20:02  tbrowder2

	* [r48868] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  reverting most of the file--need to revisit the big picture
	  before optimizing; still have problems of periodic region list
	  variation; will add the array fix for that WITHOUT the other loop
	  changes

2012-01-16 17:49  tbrowder2

	* [r48867] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  a tad of formatting

2012-01-16 17:47  tbrowder2

	* [r48866] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  add a sort comparison function for a region array; add variables
	  for array handling and hoisting loops upward

2012-01-16 17:45  tbrowder2

	* [r48865] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  use bu_fgets instead of fgets

2012-01-16 17:04  tbrowder2

	* [r48864] regress/weight.sh:
	  slight simplification

2012-01-16 12:30  d_rossberg

	* [r48863] src/conv/intaval/read_dra.cpp:
	  do not set a form's id here, it's only a flag saying "same form
	  but different place" i.e. translated
	  initialized form in its declaration to calm Coverity

2012-01-15 20:49  tbrowder2

	* [r48862] include/bu.h:
	  correct typo

	  tidy format of weight output; ease maintenance of viewweight.c
	  formatting

2012-01-15 18:05  tbrowder2

	* [r48859] src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  allow up to 5-digit material codes and region IDs; change 'item'
	  to 'region ID'

2012-01-15 13:36  tbrowder2

	* [r48858] regress/weight.sh:
	  make the weight test slightly more robust

	  Reported a bug to AStyle dev with k&r formatting of functions
	  using return types with spaces (i.e. a function returning 'void'
	  will format correctly, but one returning 'struct bn_table *'
	  won't) but otherwise results are looking fairly good - still only
	  tested a few files though, may be more bugs lurking.

	  fixed rtweight to handle blanks, comment lines, malformed lines,
	  and the modified NIST materials file; problem was fscanf stops
	  scanning on input at first error and thus the infinite loop:
	  using fgets forces each line to be read; an extra buffer is
	  needed in that case to handle the line input versus the sscan
	  buffer for reading tokens (but I didn't try using the same buffer
	  for both)

	  Rather than depend on the -1 comparison, set a control variable

	  conversion from bu_vls_init() to BU_VLS_INIT_ZERO initialization.
	  this performance tune avoids a function call and memory
	  allocation if the string is never used but, more importantly,
	  simplifies the code and makes it less error-prone in the
	  situations where we only conditionally initialized or initialized
	  much later in the logic. this commit covers approximately 45% of
	  the bu_vls_init() calls. woot: +366 -718.

	  And now, the final piece of the configuration options
	  documentation. Automatically update the INSTALL file (currently
	  pulling INSTALL.cmake, but that will change later) with changes
	  in BRL-CAD options and aliases. In keeping with the principle of
	  not touching the source directory the original INSTALL file is
	  not altered - instead, a new file is generated (INSTALL.new) and
	  a warning is printed at the end of the configure process
	  notifying the developer of the changed file. It is then up to the
	  develper to review the new INSTALL.new and copy it manually into
	  the source tree. The major benefit of this method is the
	  autogeneration of the alias lists - the same lists used by the
	  logic actually defining the aliases in CMake are also used to
	  generate the docs.

	* [r47860] include/bu.h:
	  implement more generalized BU_GET() and BU_PUT() macros intended
	  to replace BU_GETSTRUCT(), BU_GETUNION(), and BU_GETTYPE(). these
	  versions should provided added application security by
	  guaranteeing zero-init and sanity cleanup when released/put. used

	  allocator given the allocations are intrinsically small and
	  defined as dynamic.

	* [r47859] include/bu.h, include/nmg.h, src/libbu/pool.c,
	  src/librt/db5_io.c, src/librt/db5_scan.c:
	  rename the new libbu pool routines to be consistent with the
	  existing libbu api. groups functions are bu_GROUP prefix, so
	  rename bu_get_elem_from_pool() to bu_pool_get() and
	  bu_free_elem_pool() to bu_pool_put() respectively. rename all of
	  the non-public implementation functions with a non-'bu_' and
	  simpler 'pool_' prefix. update existing callers accordingly.
	  added notes on a few show-stopper issues in the implementation,
	  namely semaphore locking issues and not building on existing
	  libbu memory management (probably due to locking issues). also,
	  seems considerably overcomplicated. reasoning is evident, but
	  begs for drastic simplification (allocate a single big buffer,
	  increment a size_t as bytes are requested).

	  Coming very close to building xsltproc cross-platform for
	  guaranteed docbook->html documentation generation. Only known
	  problem is on Windows, and that seems to be primarily related to
	  the new catalog usage with the advanced Docbook formatting (to
	  the best of my knowledge, the new Docbook formatting logic has
	  never been tested on Windows before.) Setting environment
	  variables in the CMake COMMAND lines didn't go over well on
	  Windows, so have shifted to a new approach - for each docbook
	  target, write a small CMake script that contains all the proper
	  environment variable foo and commands for that target. Then the
	  custom command, rather than defining and running the command,
	  calls -P to execute the script file. That approach *does* seem to
	  do the right thing on Windows, besides having the nifty side
	  effect of making Docbook build debugging simpler by having a
	  fully expanded build command immediately available. Last step is
	  to figure out what the right voodo is for Windows - the path
	  rewrite logic isn't doing something right with the windows paths,
	  may need to dig into how that's being done and whether there are
	  build flags for Windows path handling in the xml code...

	  De-tcl two rather intertwined libbu functions, bu_observer_cmd()
	  and bu_cmd(), along with all of the command history functions.
	  Define bu_cmdtab callback signature so we get proper type
	  checking, but instead of clientdata+tclinterp, make it a void*
	  and make argv const. Those changes end up impacting nearly 8k
	  lines of caller code where we have to update the
	  (mostly-but-not-all-deprecated) various "tcl object" codes to
	  pass their data around within the new observer and cmd callbacks
	  without being explicit function parameters. Remove most of the
	  deprecated/obsolete object API declarations while we're at it so
	  further use isn't encouraged.

	  While moderately equivalent to the prior behavior, this patch
	  does change numerous command outputs from going to the Tcl
	  channel to instead getting output through bu_log. Of course, even
	  through most of the caller code is deprecated, more testing is
	  warranted (particularly for archer).

	  This involved approximately 26 hours of continuous effort. My
	  pinky is tired.

	  declare/export the new tclcad_register_cmds() function so we can
	  eliminate bu_register_cmds().

2011-12-06 07:21  brlcad

	* [r47786] src/libtclcad/tclcad.c:
	  provide an alternative to bu_register_cmds() so we can make
	  remove the bu func as a minimally impacting API change. to do
	  this, we need to wrap the bu_cmdtab functions since they're
	  similarly undergoing a signature change to eliminate the tcl
	  binding.

2011-12-06 06:07  brlcad

	* [r47785] src/libfb/tcl.c:

2011-12-05 23:46  brlcad

	* [r47779] src/libfb/fb_obj.c:

2011-12-05 23:28  starseeker

2011-12-05 22:39  starseeker

	* [r47776] src/archer/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Archer needs some more dependencies called out (mostly tcl/tk
	  packages it uses). 'make archer' now does more or less what you
	  expect - the only exception being the Docbook man pages. Not sure
	  whether to make those dependencies...

2011-12-05 22:25  starseeker

	* [r47775] src/CMakeLists.txt:
	  checking clean configure - need tclscripts target lists defined
	  before archer and mged targets are defined so a one-shot
	  configure gets the right information.

2011-12-05 22:20  starseeker

	* [r47774] src/archer/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Now that we have an archer target, hang the tclscript

2011-12-05 22:16  starseeker

	* [r47773] src/archer/CMakeLists.txt:

2011-12-05 22:03  n_reed

	* [r47771] src/other/perplex/scanner_template.c:

	  src/libtclcad/CMakeLists.txt, src/libtclcad/Makefile.am,
	  src/libtclcad/cmdhist_obj.c, src/libtclcad/tclcad.c:
	  move command history tcl objects from libbu to libtclcad,
	  changing them from init during loading of libbu to loading of
	  libtclcad. this should keep things working for archer and get
	  libbu one step closer to tcliberation.

2011-12-02 03:42  brlcad

	* [r47759] src/libbu/cmdhist_obj.c:
	  unfortunately not so simple to remove/move the tcl side of the
	  command history implementation from libbu since it involves
	  non-deprecated tclscripts api.

2011-12-02 03:35  brlcad

	* [r47758] include/bu.h, src/libbu/tcl.c:
	  change Bu_Init() to take a void* since dynamic loading should
	  still work just fine without knowing the type. helps decouple the
	  header from needing tcl.h

2011-12-02 03:30  brlcad

	* [r47757] src/libbu/cmdhist.c:
	  _bu_ prefix was a bad idea, use the file name as the prefix

2011-12-02 02:56  brlcad

	* [r47756] src/libbu/observer.c:

	  macros like BU_CKMAG_TCL and the various bn and rt macros that
	  wrapped it (like RT_CK_AP_TCL, RT_CK_RTI_TCL, BN_CK_VLIST, etc).
	  one step closer to decoupling libbu from tcl

2011-12-02 01:33  starseeker

2011-12-02 01:27  brlcad

	* [r47750] sh/template.sh:
	  don't just delete the header/footer file before aborting. we

2011-12-02 01:21  starseeker

	* [r47749] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  Try to undo r47659 without ruining the subsequent commits... this

2011-12-02 00:00  brlcad

	* [r47748] include/bu.h, src/libbu/tcl.c, src/mged/edsol.c:
	  do the same with bu_tcl_structparse_argv(). it was only used in
	  one place, so eliminate it by just making the caller code call
	  bu_structparse_argv() directly.

2011-12-01 23:38  brlcad

	* [r47747] doc/deprecation.txt, include/bu.h, src/libbu/tcl.c:

	  replace the call to bu_tcl_setup() and rt_tcl_setup() with the

	  Bu_Init() and Rt_Init() respectively. allows bu_tcl_setup() to go
	  away.

2011-12-01 23:31  brlcad

	* [r47745] src/libbu/tcl.c:
	  removed the only call to bu_get_all_keyword_values from tcl code
	  so its binding can go away. another 100 lines.

2011-12-01 23:28  brlcad

	* [r47744] src/rttherm/ssampview.tcl:
	  replace bu_get_all_keyword_values with calls to
	  bu_get_value_by_keyword. this was the only use with ill-defined
	  side effects, so reduce.

2011-12-01 23:22  brlcad

	* [r47743] src/libbu/parse.c:
	  the _bu_ prefix convention on static functions was a bad idea.
	  use a prefix based on the group/file these functions belong to,
	  i.e., parse_

2011-12-01 23:14  brlcad

	* [r47742] src/libbu/tcl.c:
	  eliminate 7 seemingly minimal-value bu tcl commands that also
	  seem to be completely unused within our code: bu_ck_malloc_ptr,
	  bu_malloc_len_roundup, bu_printb, bu_key_eq_to_key_val,

2011-12-01 22:09  starseeker

	* [r47740] CMakeLists.txt, misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake:
	  Add a second 'BRLCAD_OPTION' to test the setup. Need to think

2011-12-01 22:06  brlcad

	  oops, fix the regex to use both matched patterns.

2011-12-01 22:03  brlcad

	* [r47738] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  all of the bu_tcl_* functions are no longer public API.

2011-12-01 21:58  brlcad

	* [r47737] src/libbu/tcl.c:
	  mark the bu_cmdtab functions as HIDDEN as they don't need to be
	  public API. change their function prefix from bu_tcl_ to tcl_bu_
	  so they merely prefix the bu function name they wrap.

2011-12-01 21:47  n_reed

2011-12-01 20:53  brlcad

	* [r47733] include/bu.h, src/libbu/tcl.c:
	  remove declaration of bu_tcl*() functions that are not used
	  outside of src/libbu/tcl.c, part of gradual elimination of tcl
	  from libbu. looks like two are directly used
	  (bu_tcl_structparse_argv() by edsol.c and bu_tcl_setup() by
	  ssampview) and four others indirectly used through tclscripts.

2011-12-01 19:41  starseeker

	* [r47732] src/fb/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Ah, right - even though it's not a library, we need to sort

	  LIBRARY->EXECUTABLE

2011-11-23 23:16  brlcad

	* [r47642] src/other/re2c/CMake/FindLEMON.cmake,
	  src/other/step/CMake/FindLEMON.cmake:
	  sync top-level cmake file

2011-11-23 22:52  brlcad

	* [r47641] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake:
	  mark BRLCAD_LIBS as advanced

2011-11-23 22:47  brlcad

	* [r47640] misc/CMake/ThirdParty.cmake:
	  if BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS is set to SYSTEM and system-installed libs
	  aren't available, it's not our problem -- let them proceed as if
	  it was installed and found since that's what they asked for.
	  perhaps useful for distribution debugging.

2011-11-23 22:35  brlcad

	* [r47639] misc/CMake/ThirdParty.cmake:
	  this seems to get things back to working for the parent
	  BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS option. wasn't accounting for a stray
	  STREQUAL in the parent logic and wasn't setting the ON/OFF
	  variable consistently with the statements being printed

2011-11-23 21:58  brlcad

	* [r47638] misc/CMake/ThirdParty.cmake:
	  getting a feel for how the aggregate BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS was
	  implemented. this makes ccmake report proper propagation of the
	  parent BUNDLED (AUTO) setting (but still keying off AUTO at
	  higher precedence than BUNDLED).

2011-11-23 21:42  bob1961

	  This should get the build working again on non Windows
	  platforms... also, start the process of clearing out BRLCAD_DLL

2011-11-23 21:02  brlcad

	* [r47635] src/rt/view.c:
	  reduce the code duplication in ambient occlusion. pulling the
	  branch out of both loops is inconsequential to performance in the
	  long term.

2011-11-23 20:57  brlcad

	* [r47634] src/rt/view.c:
	  can't compile due to cmake errors, but add an ambOffset parameter
	  so you can control how far we pull away from a surface before
	  shooting ambient rays. this is intended to help 'smooth out'
	  shots against polygonal models where you get artifacts from
	  hitting nearby/neighboring polygons.

2011-11-23 20:23  brlcad

	* [r47633] Makefile.am:

	* [r47632] configure.ac:
	  put a deprecation notice in the summary too since most people
	  actually read it.

2011-11-23 20:15  brlcad

	* [r47631] configure.ac:
	  add a similar massive deprecation notice with an annoying pause
	  to configure.

	* [r47630] misc/CMake/FindGL.cmake, misc/CMake/FindX11.cmake,
	  misc/CMake/FindZLIB.cmake:
	  Add the rest of the 'full' licenses for the Kitware stuff - was
	  hoping to commit these changes back to Kitware, but either way
	  we'll have to hang on to these until we can require a modern
	  enough CMake with the changes.

2011-11-23 20:03  starseeker

	* [r47629] misc/CMake/FindLEX.cmake:
	  FindLEX.cmake is basically FindFLEX.cmake slightly generalized,
	  and we already had ourselves listed in the 'standard' CMake BSD
	  license. We may not even need this at all once the
	  perplex/re2c/lemon work is complete...

2011-11-23 20:00  starseeker

	* [r47628] misc/CMake/FindLEMON.cmake:
	  FindLEMON was originally based on FindBISON - note that fact.
	  Trying to stay close to the formatting of 'standard' CMake
	  modules for those that we might have a hope of getting accepted
	  into CMake proper at some point.

2011-11-23 19:59  brlcad

	* [r47627] autogen.sh:
	  move the deprecation section down so we're more sure echo -n
	  work. still before anything is printed.

2011-11-23 19:54  starseeker

	* [r47626] misc/CMake/CheckPrototypeExists.cmake:
	  CheckPrototypeExists.cmake is from KDE, flesh out their BSD

2011-11-23 19:47  starseeker

	* [r47625] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake,
	  misc/CMake/CheckCFileRuns.cmake:
	  Add the full license text for ChechCFileRuns.cmake - need to fix
	  up the rest of the Kitware-based files to have the full BSD
	  license txt.

2011-11-23 19:38  brlcad

	* [r47624] autogen.sh:
	  given the magnitude of impact, add a massive deprecation notice
	  to begin our requisite deprecation notification process. refer
	  them to the INSTALL file for now since there's not (yet?) an
	  equivalent step

2011-11-23 19:00  brlcad

	* [r47621] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake:
	  sync up with the same that was done for ThirdParty_Tcl.cmake
	  using consistent printing statements (e.g., they might not be
	  libs), relax to substring matching and reduced logic where we
	  can. inject blank lines, separators, and comments for improved

2011-11-23 18:52  starseeker

	  stray duplicate comment line

2011-11-23 18:48  brlcad

	* [r47619] misc/CMake/ThirdParty.cmake:
	  big restructuring in support of better reporting for whether
	  bundled or sys libs are being used (and why). few cases weren't
	  being handled and the string STREQUAL testing was causing cmake
	  to report warnings. simplify string comparisons to substrings
	  where applicable, reduce/reorder logic for clarity, and reword
	  messages for consistency.

2011-11-23 18:48  starseeker

	* [r47618] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake:
	  remove debug prints for now.

2011-11-23 18:42  starseeker

	* [r47617] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake:
	  Make an initial stab at support for library-wide usage of
	  <LIB>_DLL_IMPORTS approach to building with MSVC. This is just
	  hte macro logic and (for the moment, until the rest of this is
	  worked out) the Windows build is almost certainly well and truly
	  busted.

2011-11-23 18:40  brlcad

	* [r47616] misc/CMake/ThirdParty_TCL.cmake:
	  more logic simplification. reorder IF/ELSE to avoid needing NOT,
	  eliminate need for multiple comparisons by using substring
	  comparison. reword cache string to indicate what action is being
	  taken.

2011-11-23 18:29  brlcad

	  starseeker right on both counts, need the empty BU_EXPORT so

2011-11-23 01:45  starseeker

	  Ah - the '-' to '_' conversion ended up with BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS

2011-11-19 03:31  brlcad

	* [r47569] src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c:
	  basing the number of segments off of a chord length that's 5% of
	  the view width will still create chunkly segments (50px long for
	  a 1024 display) for large circles and sub-pixel chords for small
	  circles (less than 20px). instead, try basing the size off of the
	  circle's circumference in terms of pixels. this uses a chord
	  length of 4px so the circles are always relatively smooth
	  regardless of size. assumes from glancing through the logic that
	  'r' is actually the diameter (hopefully).
