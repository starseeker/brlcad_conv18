2007-10-30 10:05  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  search the opennurbs dir for header files, it's required when

	  requires opennurbs.h)

2007-10-30 10:12  brlcad

	* src/other/intaval/Makefile.am:
	  ah, blasted automake (or my assumptions of it). just include the
	  opennurbs cppflags here since c++ files are still in the
	  minority.

2007-10-30 10:16  brlcad

	  annotate what DRA and TGF stand for

2007-10-30 15:27  d_rossberg

	* configure.ac:
	  always set the path to the openNURBS headers (C++)

2007-10-30 15:36  brlcad

	* BUGS:
	  apparently not yet annotated, so make a note of the stupid unable
	  to find brl-cad message when rt encounters a shader it doesn't
	  recognize. the dynamic shader loading code has some bad juju in
	  it.

2007-10-31 04:48  brlcad

	* src/other/intaval/Makefile.am:
	  ah crap. the converter uses libwdb which isn't/can't be compiled
	  before src/other -- one of the few ways where recursive make
	  actually bites us in the arse. need to move the converter to a
	  directory that is traversed after src/other and after src/lib*,
	  maybe misc/intaval or contrib/intaval or src/contrib/intaval etc.
	  for now, just make the converter be compile-on-demand (i.e. cd
	  src/other/intaval && make tgf-g) only.

	* src/util/pix-png.c:
	  warn if the output PNG image dimensions are smaller than the
	  input PIX image, related to support request from mallory

2007-11-01 21:56  brlcad

	* NEWS:
	  pix-png now warns the user if the PNG being created has image
	  dimenions smaller than the PIX file that was given as input. The
	  tool compares the size of the input and output images, and
	  reports the difference if there is one; it also suggest what
	  flags the user may need to use if the input has recognizable
	  image dimensions. This feature was implemented in response to a
	  support request from Mallory where he was confused by the black
	  PNG image produced (which happened to be the top of the input PIX
	  image) since he had not specified the input image dimensions.

	  Mr. Anderson fixed various non-normalized vector bugs with the
	  ARBN primitive that was causing all sorts of problems with
	  rotations, shading, mirroring, and more. the primitive was

2007-11-10 15:27  brlcad

	* src/bwish/tcl.c:
	  just say it failed -- the actual error should already be printed
	  by the init routine

2007-11-10 15:31  brlcad

	* src/bwish/main.c:
	  yet another restructuring of the init routine. give Tcl_Init() a
	  chance to work before calling tclcad_auto_path() so that we don't
	  end up trying to force the init.tcl that is provided in the
	  source distribution. if there's a system tcl being used, it will
	  gawk at trying to load the wrong init script. this goes even
	  further such that we keep track of which packages init properly
	  and only call tclcad_auto_path() if one of them fail (or when we
	  get to the brl-cad lib loading) using a two-pass loop.

2007-11-10 15:36  brlcad

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	  drop the disabled code for setting PATH. we can/should now locate
	  execable items individually via bu_brlcad_root instead of relying
	  on PATH.

2007-11-10 15:42  brlcad

	* src/bwish/main.c:
	  a few too many results reset

2007-11-10 15:48  brlcad

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	  add a similar new two-pass initialization approach that
	  bwish/btclsh are now using such that tclcad_auto_path is only
	  called if one of the init routines actually fails. this helps
	  ensure that we can use a system tcl (though doesn't take care of
	  itcl loading/version problems). make the error printing a little
	  more consistent as well.

2007-11-10 19:31  brlcad

	* include/tclcad.h:
	  make tclcad_tcl_library take an interp

2007-11-10 19:42  brlcad

	* doc/deprecation.txt:
	  make a note that the various *_version variables are all now
	  *_version() functions now since 7.10.2 even though the globals
	  were never intended for external use (they were in headers merely
	  for compilation convenience as they were used across directories
	  in multiple files). additionally added, but not commented is the
	  'new' brlcad_version() function which isn't as library-specific
	  as the other variables.

2007-11-13 09:41  d_rossberg

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/vls.c:

	  Now, db_open calls bu_close_mapped_file if it is a re-use of a

	  fixed garbled output during parallel crash reports. if you were
	  on a parallel system with mutiple threads/procs in action when

	  the shell failure and aborts early instead of proceeding and

	  pre-link archive with just the .l nm symbol instead of .lo

2007-12-06 20:36  erikgreenwald

	* src/adrt/isst/slave/slave.c:

2007-12-07 04:50  brlcad

	  obsolete

2007-12-07 05:10  brlcad

	* src/other/blt/src/blt.h:

2007-12-07 05:17  brlcad

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  don't mention compat4.h

2007-12-07 05:19  brlcad

	* src/librt/bomb.c:
	  compat4.h is no longer needed or wanted, pretend it doesn't exist

2007-12-07 05:22  brlcad

	* src/libbu/libbu.3:
	  remove the RECOMMENDATION section that refers to compat4.h and

2007-12-07 05:41  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:
	  provide the args for a_overlap() so it can perform type checks

2007-12-07 05:45  brlcad

	* src/rttherm/viewtherm.c:
	  set the app's log overlap handler to rt_silent_logoverlap()
	  instead of setting the overlap callback to rt_overlap_quietly()

2007-12-07 06:32  brlcad

	* doc/deprecation.txt, include/raytrace.h, src/librt/bool.c:
	  rt_overlap_quietly() is now finally obsolete. no longer need the
	  _rt_defoverlap since the verbosity flag is no longer used anyways
	  as well. apps instead can set the a_logoverlap callback to a
	  logging routine (like rt_silent_logoverlap()) as the overlap
	  handler is supposed to be silent.

2007-12-07 06:36  brlcad

	* doc/deprecation.txt, include/Makefile.am, include/compat4.h:
	  compat4.h is now finally fully obsolete. it's been deprecated
	  since 5.0 and with a compilation pragma warning now for several
	  major release. it's time. just let it go. buh-bye.

2007-12-07 06:42  brlcad

	* doc/deprecation.txt, src/libbn/mat.c:
	  and then there were none. make the last of the pre-7.0
	  deprecations now finally obsolete including bn_mat_zero(),

	  provided by the api.

2007-12-07 06:51  brlcad

	  including libutahrle and a handful of the tools

2007-12-07 14:40  brlcad

	* src/rt/rt.1:
	  apply a modified form of Karel Kulhavy - clock3's sf patch [
	  1837469 ] "man rt" documentation tweak that clarifies that the -d
	  option returns zero as the distance when it misses.

2007-12-07 16:19  erikgreenwald

	* src/librt/librt.3:
	  remove mention of the obsolete (and removed) rt_overlap_quietly
	  function

2007-12-07 17:47  erikgreenwald

	* src/mged/clone.c:

	* TODO:
	  mention the todo list in clone.c

2007-12-07 18:12  brlcad

	* src/librt/g_bot.c:
	  limit the length of the face_mode copy into the bizzare use of
	  bot_data (where we intentionally go past the sizeof(struct
	  bot_rec) with the bot data for v4 files)

2007-12-08 22:17  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  check for grp.h, check for geteuid() and getegid() -- used by
	  libbu/stat.c for new file permission functions

2007-12-08 22:32  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  clean up and expand the permission/access/chmod defines for the
	  S_I* defines so we can do the same on windows we do on
	  non-windows. add missing X_OK and remove the two bogus ones for
	  eof and HAVE_PWD_H

2007-12-08 22:42  brlcad

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/stat.c:
	  add new file stat routines to libbu, bu_file_readable() and
	  bu_file_writable() and bu_file_executable(), for determining
	  permissions on a given file name for the current user. check the
	  appropriate user, group, or other permission, and should work on
	  windows too. these routines make it easy to completely avoid
	  access() as well as a means to improve error checking throughout.

2007-12-08 22:52  brlcad

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	  don't use access, use the new bu_file_readable() function instead

2007-12-08 22:53  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  remove the access() approach in bu_file_exists() and take stat()
	  for granted since it's c89 and doesn't have the security problems
	  access has

2007-12-08 22:56  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  just in case we don't have the access() interface defines for
	  R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK that we're privately using, define them if
	  needed

2007-12-08 22:57  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  don't check for or use access(), leave a note that it's
	  intentional. begin a comment about the functions we're
	  specifically assuming are available (the well-behaved ones from
	  c89).

2007-12-08 23:02  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  don't need HAVE_STAT or HAVE_ACCESS any more

2007-12-08 23:02  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  don't need to check for HAVE_STAT, assume it's available per c89

2007-12-08 23:03  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  don't check for stat(). allow/begin slow and careful dechecking
	  of well-behaved c89 functions.

2007-12-08 23:06  brlcad

	* src/adrt/isst/master/isst_python.c:
	  shouldn't need to undef HAVE_STAT, no longer checked (not that it
	  should matter)

2007-12-08 23:16  brlcad

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	  use the new bu_file_readable() routine instead of access() along
	  with bu_file_exists() when unable to open a new file.

2007-12-08 23:21  brlcad

	* src/remrt/remrt.c:
	  use the new bu_file_writable() routine instead of access() along
	  with bu_file_exists() when creating the new file.

2007-12-08 23:23  brlcad

	* src/util/bw-rle.c, src/util/pix-orle.c, src/util/pix-rle.c:
	  use bu_file_exists() instead of access()

2007-12-09 00:27  brlcad

	* src/libbu/fopen_uniq.c:
	  add comment that we can't call bu_log here because of the
	  semaphore

2007-12-09 00:36  brlcad

	* src/halftone/main.c:
	  quell warning

2007-12-09 00:37  brlcad

	* src/mged/animedit.c:
	  check buffer length whilest printing into the buffers

2007-12-09 00:37  brlcad

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  use mkstemp instead of mktemp since we can (old sgi section)

2007-12-09 00:49  brlcad

	* src/util/remapid.c:
	  looks like the libbu/file.c functions were just dumped into here.
	  rename the functions to not look like they're still bu_
	  functions. ugly hacked file. no donut for pjt.

2007-12-09 00:51  brlcad

	* include/bu.h:
	  wow, there are even two copies of the old file.c function decls,
	  and none of them exist any longer. -1 donut for pjt

2007-12-09 04:01  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  handle null/empty path

2007-12-09 04:03  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  geez, finish typing before hitting the send

2007-12-09 17:32  brlcad

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	  heh, oops -- stat returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.

2007-12-09 21:40  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  initial addition and implementation of bu_temp_file() -- a
	  relatively secure means to create a temporary file for use by
	  applications. this implementation should work on most platforms
	  including Windows that support either mkstemp (POSIX) or
	  tmpfile_s (ISO/IEC TR 24731-1) and should conform to the CERT
	  secure coding of temporary file recommendations. bu_temp_file()
	  presently doesn't take any arguments, though that may change if
	  needed by apps. it does, however, auto-delete the temporary files
	  on close through an atexit handler and a linked list of temp
	  files that have been opened. presently creates temp files in the
	  first identifiable/usable temp dir searching TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP,
	  /tmp, and the current directory, creating a file named
	  BRL-CAD_temp_XXXXXXX if using mkstemp.

2007-12-09 21:40  brlcad

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am:
	  add temp.c to the build

2007-12-09 21:41  brlcad

	* src/libbu/libbu.dsp:
	  add temp.c to the vc6 build

2007-12-09 21:43  brlcad

	* include/bu.h:
	  use BU_ASSERT instead of assert -- though it's questionable as to
	  whether BU_LIST_CLOSE needs to even exist.. it's apparently not
	  used anywhere.

2007-12-09 21:45  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  windows have tmpfile_s() .. declare the underscored TMP_MAX_S

2007-12-09 21:46  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  need to check fo mkstemp() and tmpfile_s() for the new
	  bu_temp_file() interface.

2007-12-09 21:48  brlcad

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj,
	  misc/win32-msvc8/libbu/libbu.vcproj:
	  add temp.c to the vc7 and vc8 build

2007-12-10 14:21  brlcad

	* src/adrt/libtie/tie_define.h, src/adrt/libtienet/tienet_util.h:
	  include stdint.h for the various c99 standard integer types. this
	  should fix sf bug [ 1847278 ] "Fails to compile at tienet" from
	  James Millar - j_dmillar.

2007-12-10 21:56  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Removed a few unused methods.

2007-12-10 22:00  bob1961

2007-12-11 07:51  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  indent consistency

2007-12-13 16:03  bob1961

2007-12-13 16:19  brlcad

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Makefile.am:
	  add ArcherCore.tcl to the dist

2007-12-13 20:01  brlcad

	* include/bn.h:
	  remove authorship/origin info from header, innaccurately
	  documents what is already tracked by version control

2007-12-13 20:53  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Modifications to use ArcherCore. Note - there are still a few
	  issues that need attention.

2007-12-13 20:58  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/CombEditFrame.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/GeometryEditFrame.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/pkgIndex.tcl:
	  Mods related to using ArcherCore.

2007-12-13 20:59  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Removed a debug statement.

2007-12-13 21:04  bob1961

	* src/bwish/cadAppInit.c:
	  Minor cleanup.

2007-12-13 21:05  bob1961

	* include/config_win.h:
	  define uid_t and gid_t

2007-12-13 21:06  bob1961

	* include/tclcad.h:
	  declare Tclcad_Init

2007-12-13 21:08  bob1961

	* misc/win32-msvc8/libtclcad/libtclcad.vcproj:
	  Added tclcad.c

2007-12-13 21:10  bob1961

	* src/archer/archer:
	  Mods related to using ArcherCore

2007-12-13 21:11  bob1961

	* src/libtclcad/tclcad.c:
	  Initial check-in. This provides the interface for dynamically
	  loading via Tcl.

2007-12-13 21:42  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  modify bu_temp_file() so that we can capture the name of the
	  temporary file that was created along with the opened file
	  descriptor. this requires ditching tmpfile_s() entirely on
	  windows since it returns anonymous files, instead providing an
	  implementation of mkstemp() for platforms like Windows that don't
	  provide it.

2007-12-14 10:49  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  clean up the list of temp directories that we try to identify so
	  they can all be treated/tested the same in a loop. the interface
	  should be pretty solid now.

2007-12-14 11:03  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  document the bu_temp_file() parameters, don't truncate the
	  filename if it won't fit.

2007-12-14 11:04  brlcad

	* include/bu.h:
	  declare the two parameters to bu_temp_file() for storing the
	  filename

2007-12-14 11:39  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  in order for the filename to be useful, we need to not
	  automatically unlink it right after it's opened -- add it to the
	  closure linked list and unlink the file later during application
	  exit.

2007-12-14 12:25  brlcad

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c:
	  use bu_temp_file() instead of mktemp/mkstemp for generalized temp
	  file management. fixes assumption that there's a /tmp and that we
	  can write to C:\ on windows

2007-12-14 12:31  brlcad

	* src/mged/mater.c:
	  use bu_temp_file() instead of mktemp/mkstemp for better
	  generalized temp file management. fixes assumption that there's a
	  /tmp and that we can write to C:\ on windows and keeps track of
	  the temp file better

2007-12-14 13:05  brlcad

	* src/mged/red.c:
	  use bu_temp_file() instead of mktemp/mkstemp for better
	  generalized temp file management. fixes directory assumptions and
	  cleans up temp file creation some

2007-12-14 13:11  brlcad

	* src/mged/tedit.c, src/mged/utility1.c:
	  more usage of bu_temp_file() instead of mktemp/mkstemp for better
	  generalized temp file management.

2007-12-14 13:21  brlcad

	* src/util/buffer.c:
	  use bu_temp_file() instead of using mkstemp directly and assuming
	  there's a /usr/tmp

2007-12-14 13:21  brlcad

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	  use bu_temp_file instead of mkstemp directly, ws on sgi section

2007-12-14 13:31  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  no longer need TMP_MAX_S or mktemp with the latest bu_temp_file()
	  implementation

2007-12-14 13:32  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:
	  a_overlap isn't identical to a_multioverlap -- one too many
	  struct partitions

2007-12-14 13:33  brlcad

	* src/lgt/do_options.c:
	  use bu_temp_file() for the batch file instead of assumping /tmp

2007-12-14 13:45  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:
	  take it back, librt/bool.c does feed in the partition head for
	  a_overlap, so it's the other older callers that are missing that
	  added param

2007-12-14 13:45  brlcad

	* src/librt/bool.c:
	  typo

2007-12-14 14:43  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Db.tcl:
	  Fixed the help for ocenter.

2007-12-14 14:44  bob1961

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  if windows, include <sys/stat.h>

2007-12-14 17:09  brlcad

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  system headers come before our lib headers and should never need
	  to use _WIN32 for header inclusion protection -- use/create the
	  corresponding HAVE_*_H define

2007-12-14 17:46  brlcad

	* src/libfb/fb_generic.c:
	  can't be consistent

2007-12-14 17:47  brlcad

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am:
	  one per line when more than one

2007-12-14 20:28  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  try using the -bind_at_load option on Mac OS X so that undefined
	  symbols are all resolved when the library/app is loaded instead
	  of waiting until first use

2007-12-14 20:28  brlcad

	* src/rt/viewcheck.c, src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  quell warnings, add the missing partition head pointer to the
	  overlap callback

2007-12-14 20:30  brlcad

	* src/rt/viewweight.c:
	  define the functions in order so that they don't need to be
	  declared

2007-12-14 20:36  brlcad

	* src/adrt/librender/cut.c:
	  needs another pair of eyeballs to verify, quell warning on second
	  arg to tie_push as a TIE_3 **

2007-12-14 20:42  brlcad

	* src/adrt/libutil/image.c:
	  quell warnings, zlib likes its longs unsigned

2007-12-14 20:53  brlcad

	* src/gtools/g_lint.c, src/gtools/g_qa.c, src/gtools/solshoot.c:
	  quell decl mismatch warnings

2007-12-14 20:58  brlcad

	* src/irprep/all_sf.c, src/irprep/firpass.c, src/irprep/secpass.c,
	  src/irprep/shapefact.c, src/irprep/showtherm.c:
	  quell warnings

2007-12-14 21:02  brlcad

	* src/mged/solids_on_ray.c:
	  quell overlap callback decl warning

2007-12-14 21:07  brlcad

	* src/rttherm/viewtherm.c:
	  quell warning by using NULL -- the logoverlap handler returns
	  void, RT_AFN_NULL returns an int.

2007-12-14 21:13  brlcad

	* src/util/ttcp.c:
	  give the compilation warnings one more shot at quelling the
	  socklen_t vs int vs size_t inconsistency mix that has persisted
	  over the years. posix defines socklen_t, len was int* during
	  early bsd days. may need to create our own typedef if non-posixy
	  so it can still compile stand-alone

2007-12-14 21:27  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Command.tcl:
	  Added the reinitialize method.

2007-12-14 21:29  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl:
	  Removed the dir parameter from both LoadArcherCoreLibs and
	  LoadArcherLibs.

2007-12-14 21:31  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/ArcherCore.tcl:
	  Added a few class variables that were previously in the Archer
	  class.

2007-12-14 21:33  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Added code to change the prompt. Also move a few class variables
	  to ArcherCore.

2007-12-14 21:35  bob1961

	* src/archer/archer:
	  Mods related to class variables moving from Archer to ArcherCore.

2007-12-15 05:08  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  don't need HAVE_MATHERR

2007-12-15 05:09  brlcad

	* src/mged/anal.c:
	  remove the old acos() hack to quell implementation errors by
	  overriding matherr()

2007-12-15 05:17  brlcad

	* src/librt/Makefile.am, src/librt/sqrt.gould.s,
	  src/librt/sqrt.vax.s:
	  remove the unused assembler sqrt() implementations for the gould
	  and vax. relinquish to the bowels of revision history until there
	  is (ever) a need to properly reintegrate into the build (where
	  they probably belong in libbn)

2007-12-15 05:22  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  libtool on mac chokes on the -bind_at_load, get rid of it

2007-12-15 05:37  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  no longer need HAVE_TMPFILE_S, no longer using tmpfile_s()

2007-12-15 05:39  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  no longer using tmpfile_s(), don't check for it

2007-12-15 05:42  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  we don't use ftime()

2007-12-15 06:22  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  include a comprehensive list of c89 functions that I'm aware of
	  that should be a near-complete list of functions we should be
	  able to rely on. this does NOT include some of the POSIX.1
	  functions, but it should be a near-complete list otherwise.
	  functions compiled from the following headers: assert.h ctype.h
	  locale.h math.h setjmp.h signal.h stdarg.h stddef.h stdio.h
	  stdlib.h string.h time.h

2007-12-15 07:53  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h, src/libbu/malloc.c:
	  consider calloc() a given with c89

2007-12-15 07:55  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  comment on the libsysv calls we check for even though they're
	  c89. don't check calloc()

2007-12-15 08:10  louipc

	* misc/archlinux/PKGBUILD.static:
	  On second thought this won't really work too well. Removing.

2007-12-15 08:12  louipc

	* misc/archlinux/Makefile.am:
	  Remove PKGBUILD.static from dist.

2007-12-15 08:44  brlcad

	* src/burst/prnt.c, src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/lgt/execshell.c,
	  src/libpkg/pkg.c, src/other/URToolkit/tools/into.c:
	  strerror is c89, and does work on windows at least with vc8 so
	  drop the obsolete and error-prone sys_errlist array alternates
	  and configure check

2007-12-15 09:09  brlcad

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	  we have getenv()

2007-12-15 09:17  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h, src/libbu/linebuf.c, src/util/pixcut.c,
	  src/util/pixpaste.c:
	  take setvbuf for granted per c89, bye bye HAVE_SETVBUF

2007-12-15 09:17  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  don't need to check for setvbuf and strerror funcs any more

2007-12-15 16:52  brlcad

	* configure.ac, include/config_win.h:
	  don't need to check for getenv(), go c89

2007-12-15 17:20  brlcad

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	  raise() works on windows and is c89, so bye bye

2007-12-15 18:01  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  raise() works on windows and is c89, so bye bye

2007-12-15 18:03  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  strdup and strsep don't seem to be c89

2007-12-15 20:13  brlcad

	* configure.ac, src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	  get rid of our single use of strerror_r, minimize checks

2007-12-15 20:29  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  remove a whole bunch of function checks that can be taken for
	  granted since c89 provides for them. all of these functions are
	  apparently not even used (any more) via HAVE_ decls regardless.
	  removing the checks reduces configure time signficantly. function
	  checks removed include atexit, fabs, floor, memchr, memmove,
	  modf, pow, setlocale, sqrt, strcpy, strcspn, strpbrk, strrchr,
	  strspn, strstr, strtol, strtoul, strtoull

2007-12-15 20:44  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  comment consistency

2007-12-15 21:09  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  list the POSIX.1 headers too for good measure

2007-12-15 21:17  bharder

	* doc/book/VolumeIV.xml:
	  Working with new processing to facilitate img handling, re-worked
	  <link> and <xref>, minor formatting.

2007-12-15 21:29  bharder

	* doc/book/VolumeIV.xml:
	  Previous commit also re-worked the placement of authorship from
	  <title> to <bookinfo> and the dedication from <prolog> to
	  <dedication> -- not sure about the <author> change... will need
	  to keep eye on this.

2007-12-16 15:14  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  no longer check for bzero, begin conversion to memset

2007-12-16 15:31  brlcad

	* include/machine.h:
	  bzero is POSIX.1, memset is c90 -- pick the latter for now and
	  remove bzero from machine.h

2007-12-16 15:33  brlcad

	* include/bu.h, include/raytrace.h:
	  ws

2007-12-16 15:34  brlcad

	* include/nmg.h:
	  begin bzero -> memset conversion

2007-12-16 15:42  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  remove a slew of function checks that have no corresponding
	  HAVE_* define use in the code reducing configure time by another
	  significant amount. functions included are: dup2, endgrent,
	  endpwent, finite, fttruncate, getcwd, gethostbyaddr,
	  gethostbyname, getpagesize, getpass, gettimeofday, inet_ntoa,
	  isascii, isfinite, localtime_r, mkdir, mkfifo, munmap,
	  ml_langinfo, panic, prtcl, putenv, re_comp, realpath, rmdir,
	  select, setlinebuf, socket, strcasecmp, strncasecmp, tzset,
	  uname, utime

2007-12-16 15:59  brlcad

	* misc/macosx/openUp.c, src/burst/fb.c, src/canon/canonlib.c,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/util/ttcp.c:
	  convert all bzero calls to memset

2007-12-16 16:02  brlcad

	* include/machine.h:
	  fully remove the bzero/bcopy section

2007-12-16 16:05  brlcad

	* src/libbu/bitv.c, src/libbu/malloc.c, src/librt/nmg_plot.c,
	  src/sig/dwin.c, src/tab/tabinterp.c, src/util/pixtile.c:
	  few multiline bzero to memset stragglers

2007-12-16 16:09  brlcad

	* HACKING:
	  comment on using memset and memcpy instead of bzero and bcopy

2007-12-16 16:48  brlcad

	* src/libbu/convert.c:
	  not clear whether the two regions can overlap, so convert bcopy
	  to memmove

2007-12-16 16:49  brlcad

	* src/libbu/htond.c, src/libbu/htonf.c:
	  memcpy has been part of strings.h since c90, get rid of the
	  HAVE_MEMORY_H condition and bcopy alternate

2007-12-16 18:53  brlcad

	* src/adrt/isst/slave/load.c, src/adrt/isst/slave/slave.c,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/util/ttcp.c:
	  convert usages of bcopy to memcpy throughout. although none of
	  them should be buffers that overlap per machine.h history, all
	  calls were individually checked regardless. new code should not
	  use bzero/bcopy any more.

2007-12-16 20:13  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  not using HAVE_GETOPT anywhere, no need to check for getopt

2007-12-16 20:13  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  erm, adrt does use HAVE_GETOPT_LONG, though, so check for
	  getopt_long

2007-12-16 20:54  brlcad

	* sh/trimconfig.sh:
	  initial script that reports what defines are being declared in a
	  configure template via function checks, header checks, and manual
	  defines. it correlates what is being set/checked with what is
	  used in the sources and reports how many uses there are. this is
	  usefull in culling checks/defines that are not being used.

2007-12-16 20:55  brlcad

	* sh/Makefile.am:
	  provide the trimconfig.sh script since it should be fairly
	  generic to any configure.ac file

2007-12-16 21:03  brlcad

	* sh/trimconfig.sh:
	  make the SKIP tests actually skip and make the AC_DEFINES checks
	  actually work

2007-12-16 21:09  brlcad

	* sh/trimconfig.sh:
	  cleanup printing

2007-12-16 21:27  brlcad

	* src/libbu/malloc.c:
	  memset missing comma

2007-12-16 22:19  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/masonry.c:
	  oops, subscripted value is neither array nor pointer

2007-12-16 22:23  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  remove checks for a slew of headers that seem to have no
	  corresponding HAVE_*_H in use anywhere in our sources. these
	  include arpa/inet.h, ieeefp.h, itcl.h, itk.h, langinfo.h,
	  malloc.h, netdb.h, socket.h, strings.h, sys/resource.h,
	  sys/statfs.h, sys/timeb.h, utime.h, values.h, waitflags.h, and
	  wchar.h

2007-12-17 01:42  brlcad

	* include/machine.h:
	  BOOL_T isn't even used any more

2007-12-17 02:13  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:
	  ws

2007-12-17 02:14  brlcad

	* include/config_win.h:
	  no longer should be using nor needing the bzero/bcopy macros --
	  should be using memset and memcpy throughout now

2007-12-17 02:16  brlcad

	* include/bn.h, include/machine.h, src/libbn/complex.c,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/rttherm/viewtherm.c:
	  removal of the FAST declaration throughout. now using register or
	  letting the compiler sort things out.

2007-12-17 02:22  brlcad

	* src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	  revert int back to BOOL, windows thing

2007-12-17 05:53  brlcad

	* src/tclscripts/geometree/tclIndex, src/tclscripts/mged/tclIndex,
	  src/tclscripts/rtwizard/lib/tclIndex,
	  src/tclscripts/sdialogs/scripts/tclIndex,
	  src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/tclIndex:
	  revert the rest of the bad tclIndex files that were clobbered
	  during the 2007/11/28 commit with log "LOCAL->static, per
	  machine.h deprecation list"

2007-12-17 06:33  brlcad

	* doc/html/manuals/Install.html:
	  remove references to LOCAL and FAST

2007-12-17 07:53  brlcad

	* src/libbn/mat.c, src/libbn/plane.c, src/libbn/poly.c,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/rt/viewrad.c, src/rt/viewscat.c, src/rt/worker.c:
	  my bad deprecation instruction, revert/remove the LOCAL -> static
	  conversion. LOCAL is only static for non-SMP systems, but usually
	  auto.

2007-12-17 07:54  brlcad

	* include/machine.h:
	  poof, make LOCAL go away entirely. the deprecation instruction
	  was wrong/bad -- LOCAL shouldn't go to static, it just goes away
	  (so we get auto).

2007-12-17 08:17  brlcad

	* src/librt/g_hf.c:
	  remove silly rcsid printing

2007-12-17 08:29  brlcad

	* src/lgt/reflect.c:
	  add last partition param

2007-12-17 13:24  d_rossberg

	  time() is declared in time.h

2007-12-17 13:33  d_rossberg

	  bu_exit() is declared in bu.h

2007-12-17 13:55  d_rossberg

	* src/librt/db_tree.c:
	  do not forget to copy a string's terminating 0

2007-12-17 14:48  bob1961

	* src/conv/asc2g.c:
	  Fixed a bug related to trying to close a null file pointer.

2007-12-17 15:01  brlcad

	* NEWS:
	  parker fixed asc2g bug on Windows that caused a crash on exit

2007-12-17 15:09  brlcad

	* src/librt/db_tree.c:
	  sanity, manually null-terminate after the strncpy in case the
	  buffer is 'full' -- should consider a bu_strncpy or bu_strlcpy
	  that does this automatically

2007-12-17 18:23  bob1961

	* src/libdm/dm-ogl.c, src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	  Set flag to clear back buffer in drawBegin routine.

2007-12-17 19:17  brlcad

	  appropriate null-termination behavior is matched from the strl
	  family. warnings are printed if we exceed the specified max size.
	  similar to bu_strdup(), the interface is wrapped in macros so
	  that we can report file:line numbers when there is a problem.
	  additionally, move bu_strdupm into here from malloc.c

	  new example footer using c-file-style so that the style is
	  encouraged more strictly. setting the c-file-style effectly
	  causes a c-set-style to get invoked for that buffer, with the
	  predefined 'stroustrup' style most closely matching our
	  convention (it's basically 'k&r' with 4-char indents), this fixes
	  the braindead default 'gnu' style emacs uses that indents the
	  c-offsets-alist substatement-open style parameter a level (i.e.,
	  open brace curlies are indented a level ahead of the proceeding
	  statement).

2008-01-16 06:35  brlcad

	* sh/footer.sh:
	  add a c-file-style to the C files and remove their corresponding
	  c-basic-offset lines. can't override the c-basic-offset if using
	  a style, not that we want/need to with stroustrup since it
	  matches our offset

2008-01-16 06:38  brlcad

	* TODO:
	  include the list of remaining mged tasks for this release and the
	  next, including the questions and comments mentioned at the last
	  arl/brl-cad configuration control board meeting. immediate tasks
	  include fixing mged i/o on puts/gets; text flooding; disabling
	  mged auto-backgrounding; and fixing tclConfig.sh problems. next
	  are verifying/testing pix-fb -p, clone mirroring, dbconcat with a
	  prefix, and pushing primitives. longer term is windows smp
	  support, new tree traversal code, and exposing nmg_fix_normals
	  through a userland command.

2008-01-16 06:40  brlcad

	* HACKING:
	  change the ordering so the c-file-style is last

2008-01-16 07:06  brlcad

	* bench/pixcmp.c, include/RtServerImpl.h, include/anim.h,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/vdeck/vextern.h, src/vdeck/vproc.c:
	  set a c-file-style globally in the local variables footer,
	  setting it to the built-in 'stroustrup' style. that style is
	  basically the 'k&r' style with 4-char indents (otherwise emacs'
	  'k&r' style has 5-char indents), which matches our convention.
	  you can't specify c-basic-offset when you used c-file-style
	  apparently (at least as of emacs 21.2.1) but conveniently the
	  'stroustrup' style matches so we don't have to care.

2008-01-16 14:29  brlcad

	* src/liborle/rle.c:
	  cleanup and restructure, apply style, remove decls

2008-01-16 14:36  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  only look for the tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh files if we're not
	  building tcl or tk and need to load the config, otherwise having
	  TCL_BIN_DIR set isn't too useful (the --with/--without flags are
	  still available). this should fix the configure exit being
	  encountered on some systems when a system tcl/tk isn't already
	  installed (i.e., the WARNING: Can't find Tcl configuration
	  definitions 'error')

2008-01-16 18:26  brlcad

	* src/adrt/isst/observer:
	  you have to delete the directories too when they're empty with
	  svn since they're tracked entities (you can svn rm an entire
	  subdir as one-operation)

2008-01-16 18:26  brlcad

	* configure.ac:
	  remove the src/adrt/isst/observer/Makefile entry since the dir is
	  empty/gone

2008-01-16 21:03  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am, src/proc-db/sgi.sh:
	  add an example of creating geometry using basic shell scripting.
	  the example shows several ways for passing modeling commands to
	  mged, creates the .g geometry file, sets material properties, and
	  renders the model to an image. don't install it, just an example.

2008-01-16 21:05  bob1961

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	  Hack to get "puts" working on Windows. Still need to look at this

	* src/mged/dm-X.c, src/mged/dm-ogl.c, src/mged/dm-tk.c,

2008-01-16 21:39  erikgreenwald

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	  Improve text display routines to provide more informative render
	  method information as well as "good" when needed. Add functions
	  to translate between a numeric method ID and a human readable
	  string. Minor format cleanup.

2008-01-16 21:46  erikgreenwald

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	  Wrapper for multiple normal methods added. Isopotential normals
	  fixed with the help of Ed.

2008-01-16 21:57  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/sgi.sh:
	  match the cube rendering more closely lining up the center
	  better, adding a little bit of perspective, and using a tube
	  radius that better approximates. keep the png as sgi.png..

2008-01-17 00:57  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/sgi.sh:
	  add the same comments that were used for the wiki page so that it

2008-01-17 02:34  johnranderson

	* src/gtools/g_diff.c:
	  fixed two bugs. One was incorrect use of strcmp. Second was not
	  counting some differences found. Fixes bug #1865987

2008-01-17 02:50  louipc

	* misc/archlinux/PKGBUILD.in:
	  Install script actually shouldn't be in sources.
	  No need to specify source tarball since the build scripts are
	  included in the dist.

	  brep_simple.g creation -- always create the .g file

2008-01-17 19:55  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/brep_simple.cpp:
	  make sure we could make the twisted cube before calling mk_brep

2008-01-17 23:17  bob1961

	* src/libbu/temp.c:
	  Closing a file descriptor after an fclose breaks on windows.

2008-01-17 23:21  bob1961

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	  Make the default editor for windows wordpad. When writing out the
	  primitives on windows use crlf. Lastly, on windows change the
	  return value to 1 in editit().

2008-01-18 00:19  johnranderson

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	  ted on an arb now displays the expected vertices

	* NEWS:
	  Bob fixed a bug in mged's rcc-cap command where using the 't'

	* NEWS:
	  John fixed a bug in g_diff where differences between objects were
	  getting missed due to the command not keeping track of the count
	  of differences that had accummulated up to that point. there was
	  also an incorrect strcmp call that had the wrong truth value
	  getting tested. this fixes a bug reported by David Loman ([
	  1865987 ] g_diff fails to see BoT Orientation change)

2008-01-18 06:45  brlcad

	* NEWS:
	  bob improved the mged ted command on windows, making the files
	  being written out actually use windows line terminators so they
	  don't wrap around as one line. he also made wordpad the default
	  editor instead of notepad (user can still override) -- this
	  responds to requests for functional text edit support on windows
	  from several bnd modelers

2008-01-18 06:51  brlcad

	* NEWS:
	  John Anderson improved the way the ted command in mged deals with
	  ARBs that are less than ARB8s (e.g. an ARB6) .. instead of
	  duplicating the points and requiring users to edit the
	  duplications, only present them with the # points for their ARB#.
	  this fixes a bug report submitted by karel/clock3 where there was
	  unexpected behavior that the edits where intenional and that the
	  user had to edit the duplicates ([ 1842596 ] ted on arbn6 doesn't
	  change vertices)

2008-01-18 19:45  brlcad

	* src/libwdb/brep.cpp:
	  need a copy of the users brep here because wdb_export will free
	  the brep when it's done with it. mk_brep doesn't need to claim
	  the brep, so we can let callers keep using that brep with mods
	  for future mk_brep() calls (with a different name)

2008-01-18 19:47  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/brep_cube.cpp, src/proc-db/brep_simple.cpp:
	  the two lines aren't needed, and the edge orientations do seem to
	  make sense so remove the XXX ???'s. since mk_brep changed, we
	  need to delete the brep ourselves (which is good because we had
	  to new it in the first place)

2008-01-18 19:49  brlcad

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	  provide an initial implementation of the describe command that
	  uses the ON Dump() call for describing arbitrary breps
	  consistently. ... so nice to be able to use mid-scope decls..
	  *sigh*. also remove the m_object_table count debug statement.

2008-01-18 19:51  brlcad

	* src/proc-db/Makefile.am, src/proc-db/breplicator.cpp:
	  add a new breplicator proc-db test app for creating a variety of

	  points in it, saving out to a .g file. next step, create a
	  variety of arbs.

	  sweeping string management changes to help ensure more

	  bu_strlcpy/bu_strlcat where appropriate passing the size of the
	  buffer (expected to be a NULL-terminated C-string) instead of
	  calling strcat/strncat/strcpy/strncpy. this lets us get rid of
	  most of the sanity/manual null-terminations. also update to use
	  sizeof instead of hard-coded constants where useful. hopefully
	  not too many/any bugs getting introduced though the entire commit
	  was painstakingly reviewed at least three times over and passed
	  all manual testing as well as the regress tests.

	  src/mged/ged.c, src/rt/main.c:
	  refactor libpkg so that the windows-specific pkg_init and
	  pkg_terminate functions should no longer be necessary. according
	  to the msdn docs, the functions may be called multiple times as
	  they internally reference count the number of calls to each and
	  deallocated on the last/matching WSACleanup that corresponds to
	  the number of calls to WSAStartup. the calls were moved directly
	  into pkg_open and pkg_close (which will get picked up by all
	  callers including fb_open) and removed from all callers. this
	  should fix all of the libpkg-using network apps like all of the
	  framebuffer utilities that still need to be ported as well as
	  more consistently now automatically ties in the cleanup call to
	  the pkg connection closure. hopefully this doesn't cause bob
	  problems (i.e. it's untested.. ;)

	  directly to a pix file via libfb. the problem was the file was
	  not opened in 'binary mode', which is required on windows or it
	  will perform EOL translations (wreaking all sorts of havoc of

	* NEWS, src/librt/wdb_obj.c, src/mged/cmd.c,
	  src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl:
	  improve and clean up dbconcat's behavior, now allowing users to
	  specify either a prefix, a suffix, no affix, or an
	  auto-incrementing suffix/prefix when importing. if there is a
	  name conflict on import, the user is notified that they didn't
	  get what they asked for. this mod was annotated on sf bug 1816012
	  from david loman (dbconcat segfaults) that jra already fixed.

2008-01-28 00:12  brlcad

2008-01-28 00:35  brlcad

	* BUGS, NEWS, src/librt/db_scan.c:
	  mged now no longer dies in an assertion failure when the geometry
	  file is bogus. it properly reports that things don't seem right
	  and continues gracefully. this handles the simple test case of
	  'touch file.g && mged -c file.g units m' that was bombing out.
	  now it detects/reports that it's a bogus geometry file and marks
	  the file read-only.

2008-01-28 00:40  brlcad

	* BUGS:
	  'lt object' no longer crashes mged. presumably related to my
	  earlier fix that made mged not crash when given lt on empty
	  objects.

2008-01-28 00:47  brlcad

	* BUGS:
	  calling xpush on objects with empty trees now works, probably
	  either related to the xpush of primitives fix that erik made or
	  the dbconcat processing of empty combinations fix that john made.
	  either way, tested and now seems to work just fine (it drops the
	  matrix since there's nothing to push it onto).

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	  fix a bug introduced with the changeover of db_open to only using
	  standard i/o for all platforms instead of unix i/o with an
	  uninitialized dbi_fd. the problem was related to the failure case
	  where null is returned, which mged intentionally uses to
	  determine if a file exists, where since with unix i/o a fp and an
	  fd are independently opened (instead of deriving one from the
	  other) so the cleanup code was closing the other. the close code
	  was only checking for non-negative but with dbi_fd unitialized,
	  this was fd 0 (i.e. stdin) which in turn caused Bad Things (tm)
	  to happen. the bug was actually only exposed through the spdi
	  regression test since it directs input which is read in with
	  bu_vls_gets (i.e. via gets and stdin), which was of course
	  failing after the db_open call that closed fd 0. most
	  interestingly, subsequent calls to db_open that succeed would
	  create a valid stream and assign it fd 0. add some file comments
	  while we're in here.

	  awesome, dbi_fd is already in a struct sections marked as private
	  (for librt only) and subject to change .. so change^Wremove it.
	  there are surprisingly few uses even in librt, so it seems really
	  safe to remove the fd and avoid repeating the same bug of
	  corrupting file pointer streams by closing their associated
	  descriptor. go ahead and remove it, callers can always call
	  fileno(dbi_fp) if they really need to do unix i/o.

	* BUGS, TODO:
	  annotate the results of the OpenGL framebuffer bug hunt. the

	  ogl framebuffer interface. with PARALLEL turned off, it works
	  just fine; with it on, the app crashes during the first OpenGL
	  write call into the glx context likely indicating that either the
	  context initialization is invalid (perhaps needing to occur
	  per-thread) or data needs to be semaphore protected. either way,
	  enough progress was made to push the interface back another
	  release since the specific cause is still unclear.

2008-02-14 07:10  brlcad

	* include/bu.h, include/machine.h, src/libbu/bitv.c:
	  rewrite how the BU_BITV_SHIFT is calculated, instead of using
	  hard-coded constants in machine.h it now determines the value
	  automatically at compile-time. this was achieved using an inlined
	  integer log2 function that computes the size based on
	  sizeof(bitv_t), using a technique from the U. of Kentucky's
	  Aggregate Magic Algorithms collection. a cursory performance
	  impact analysis was performed testing both unoptimized and
	  optimized compilations (on Mac OS X 10.4, gcc 4.0.1) with results
	  looking quite reasonable. performance did decrease moderately for
	  unoptimized (by approx 10%) but also interestingly increased (by
	  approx 10%) for optimized, undoubtedly due to cache/alignment and
	  branching effects. this approach beats a configure-time test
	  since it will acquire the correct shift at run-time from
	  Universal/multi-architecture binaries.

	  type is one of BU_BIG_ENDIAN BU_LITTLE_ENDIAN and BU_PDP_ENDIAN

	  profiling showed that it was actually faster to compute than to

	  src/util/wavelet.c, src/util/yuv-pix.c, src/vas4/vas4.1:
	  categoric removal of the source, author, and function list
	  sections in files, particularly the source file header sections.
	  those are all sections of data that are more often incomplete or
	  out-of-date than they are correct and are a maintenance burden
	  that has no direct benefit. the 'source' section (i.e. the
	  address) is mostly irrelevant with the open sourcing. the
	  authorship is better comprehensively preserved through the SCM
	  revision control system, and was the most common to be incomplete
	  data (aside from the matter of not having clear criteria for
	  knowing when someone could add their name to the list). the
	  function lists were rarely ever updated, often listing
	  non-existent functions or missing more than it documented. the
	  header is meant to be a description of the file's purpose more
	  than its content -- functions should have their own doxygen
	  comment header. this commit modifies all files with a 21005 zip
	  code.
	  
	  additionally, there is an interesting assertion by brian
	  fitzpatrick and ben collins-sussman in their poisonous people
	  talk regarding how having authors listed in source files is
	  perceived by potential new contributors. namely that it can
	  become a barrier to their contributing (whether due to ownership,
	  politics, affiliations, personalities, "I'm not worthy", or some
	  other reason). it's an interesting thought, though the real
	  reason remains that there are bigger maintenance burden and
	  incompleteness problems for long term usability.

	  WORDS_BIGENDIAN where not feasible. while this doesn't change the

	  configure test warn more verbosely if we encounter something that
	  may not be ieee 754 floating point format (which in turn might

	* bench/pixcmp.c, include/Makefile.am, include/bio.h,
	  ... lots of other files ...,
	  src/vdeck/parsarg.c, src/vdeck/vdeck.c:
	  Add a new bio.h private wrapper header for consistently defining
	  native and standard I/O interfaces provided via stdio.h,
	  unistd.h, io.h, and fcntl.h. remove the 300+ instances of a
	  HAVE_UNISTD_H block throughout with a simple include of bio.h.
	  this change was also motivated by the need to remove all of the
	  header includes from the windows-specific config_win32.h (so that
	  winsock2.h can be included before windows.h cleanly). of course,
	  needs windows testing and perhaps a few file tweaks given how
	  many files were modified.

	* NEWS:
	  Bob fixed a bug in the X11 framebuffer interface where it would

	  whether the framebuffer window had focus or not. this issue was
	  related to a problem with the visual type and colormapping where
	  a bad visual was being selected. now it selects a truecolorvisual
	  (instead of directcolor iirc).

2008-02-28 21:18  brlcad

	* NEWS:
	  like the X framebuffer type, Bob added the same functionality to

	  window.

2008-02-29 01:20  brlcad

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Dm.tcl:
	  gah, merge a fix made for 7.10.4 on the stable branch that didn't

	* db/Makefile.am:
	  keep getting parallel build problems where the exec test fails
	  saying asc2g doesn't exist yet. try syncing the filesystem and if
	  it does still fail, print what ls shows

2008-03-02 08:45  brlcad

	* db/Makefile.am:
	  the more I think about it, the failure makes sense. the asc2g
	  wrapper is kicking off a compilation which causes a failure when
	  another proc tries to use the script mid-compilation. it is
	  either deleted or is getting set -x during compilation. hopefully
	  this prep phase will make it behave.

2008-03-02 08:57  brlcad

	* Makefile.am:
	  add a distcheck and install check to make sure that the tclIndex
	  and pkgIndex.tcl files aren't empty. there are some
	  configurations generating empty files when the auto_paths are not
	  set up correctly. the installs will seem to be just fine .. but
	  are actually rather busted and will result in a variety of screwy
	  run-time tcl failures when trying to use any of those routines.
	  also make elapsed.sh use top_srcdir for the DATE file since it's
	  a BUILT_SOURCES file.

2008-03-02 16:03  brlcad

	* TODO:
	  bob, erik, and myself have all failed at reproducing the mged

	  sensitive to timing issues and isn't easy to provoke on fast
	  machines. needs to be revisited on a slow machine, but that
	  doesn't need to hold up the release.

	  unfortunately raytrace.h needs windows.h (on a Win32 platform)
	  but bio.h has to be included right after the system includes,
	  therefore it can not be included in raytrace.h (this would be to
	  late)
	  this are the changes for the core libraries only, there are
	  certainly more in other libraries necessary

2008-03-04 15:16  d_rossberg

	  this will very-likely re-break the build on Windows, but bio.h is
	  a private header and cannot be included in any public headers.
	  (e.g. it shouldn't ever be installed.)

2008-03-05 07:13  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:

	* include/raytrace.h:

2008-03-05 09:36  brlcad

	* regress/flawfinder.sh:
	  add another coding check for the common.h inclusion ordering.
	  this makes sure common.h always comes first if/when listed in a
	  file. alas the script isn't tweaked to work right if there are
	  spaces in the path name, but then there are probably other
	  scripts like that in regress too

	* NEWS, src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  remove the protections for the 'm' mode in the opengl framebuffer
	  as well as requesting indirect buffers, now always requesting
	  direct and seeing what we get. my always doing 'multiple window
	  mode', the code now (correctly) acquires and releases the opengl
	  context for all of the drawing so that there aren't multithreaded
	  crashes on mac and linux. bob and I tag-teamed tracking down the
	  cause and a fix for this bug over a couple days. interestingly,
	  the crash on linux only occurred after he 'fixed' the linux
	  behavior to always use a direct color map (upon which it began
	  consistently crashing like the Mac).

2008-03-06 06:56  brlcad

	* src/adrt/libutil/camera.c, src/bwish/cadAppInit.c,
	  src/libtclcad/tclcad.c, src/mged/attach.c,
	  src/mged/points/points_scan.l, src/util/xyz-pl.c:
	  common.h always comes first, there's a regression test that
	  checks for this now too

2008-03-06 14:58  erikgreenwald

	* src/vas4/Makefile.am:
	  disable build (but leave in dist for this release)

2008-03-06 15:04  erikgreenwald

	* configure.ac:
	  favor -lpthread to -pthread

2008-03-06 15:31  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Put back a few class variables (i.e. they fell out during the
	  ArcherCore transition) and make a few plugin related methods
	  public.

2008-03-06 15:37  brlcad

	* regress/flawfinder.sh:
	  make sure we have a python interpreter before proceeding with the
	  flawfinder test

2008-03-06 15:41  brlcad

	* TODO:
	  the ogl framebuffer problem is crashed, though it still needs
	  some cleanup. it's making way too many calls to get/release the
	  context now so it's dog-slow .. need to try what bob had which
	  was just protecting write()

2008-03-06 15:52  brlcad

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  woo hoo! the performance problems were simply because several of
	  the glXMakeCurrent acquire/release pairings were .. wrong.
	  rather, they're in the wrong place with respect to the logic
	  sometimes only acquiring in a specific scope but then releasing
	  in a different scope. made them all consistent and sure enough it
	  all behaves spiffily now .. yay for the return of the ogl
	  framebuffer.

2008-03-06 15:54  brlcad

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  remove dead code, just makes maintenance a bitch

2008-03-06 16:01  brlcad

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	  more dead code removal

2008-03-06 16:07  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Display.tcl:
	  Modify rt and rtedge methods to stop unnecessarily specifying
	  parameters like framebuffer, width, height and aspect.

2008-03-06 16:11  brlcad

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	  make the wgl interface do the same as the ogl interface, fixing
	  the various incorrectly scoped wglMakeCurrent calls so that they
	  actually pair up correctly with the logic. also, actually make
	  them release the context (the code was wrong, they just kept it)
	  so when parallel support is added to windows, it'll actually
	  work.

2008-03-06 16:39  bob1961

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	  Try to get a direct context (speed).

2008-03-06 20:02  erikgreenwald

	* TODO:
	  note "minimal system" testing

2008-03-06 21:19  erikgreenwald

	* src/librt/g_metaball.c:
	  fluff up the isopotential method a bit... back to the old way,
	  kinda

2008-03-06 21:42  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/geometree/GeometryBrowser.tcl:
	  Remove extra set of double quotes in format statement of rgbToHex
	  method.

2008-03-06 22:31  erikgreenwald

	* src/mged/typein.c:
	  set a default "goo" value on metaballs

2008-03-07 02:16  brlcad

	* doc/deprecation.txt, include/wdb.h:
	  deprecate mk_fastgen_comb() .. should just use mk_comb() or
	  mk_lcomb()

2008-03-07 02:37  brlcad

	* include/raytrace.h:
	  cleanup comments on LOS

2008-03-07 02:41  brlcad

	* NEWS, src/conv/fast4-g.c:
	  make the regions being created by fastf-g default to setting the
	  material code to 1 and LOS to 100 so that it actually matches the
	  defaults that the modeler and librt use. this quick tweak
	  implements a request from dwayne kregel (S2 SCR 918) .. which I
	  just heard about it a few min ago.

2008-03-07 03:39  starseeker

	* db/terra.dsp:
	  Update props on terra.dsp to avoid file size issues when running
	  demo.

	* misc/archlinux/PKGBUILD.in, misc/archlinux/brlcad.install.in,
	  misc/archlinux/brlcad.sh.in:
	  I'm making Arch Linux packaging scripts mostly static.
	  It seems the most practical thing to do.

2008-03-07 18:58  bob1961

	* src/tclscripts/geometree/GeometryBrowser.tcl:
	  Add a few menu bindings to get things working a little better
	  (i.e. right button to bring up menu, as before, and release to
	  invoke menu item.

2008-03-07 21:45  bob1961
