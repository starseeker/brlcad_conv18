2009-09-29 01:59  brlcad

	* [r36072] src/mged/mged.c:
	  argc/argv are no longer offset. they're just the remaining args
	  of filename+command. unbreak mged argument parsing.

	* [r36069] src/libged/sphgroup.c:

	  Add -u option to 3dm-g converter for UUID based object names.

2009-09-28 21:38  starseeker

	* [r36065] src/conv/3dm/3dm-g.cpp:
	  Add a -u option to the 3dm-g converter - if -u is supplied, the
	  UUID (openNURBS's unique identifier) will be used to name objects
	  rather than the name. Since BRL-CAD requires a unique name on a
	  per object basis, this offers a 'last resort' to get fully legal
	  (if rather useless) names.

2009-09-28 19:41  bob1961

	* [r36055] src/librt/primitives/pipe/pipe_brep.cpp:

	* [r36033] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch_brep.cpp:
	  Ah, finally - switch from doing things manually to using the
	  NewPlanarFaceLoop routine, which involves recognizing loops using

	  the example sketch.

2009-09-24 21:33  brlcad

	* [r36032] sh/news2tracker.sh:
	  tweaks to the script to compensate for a bug in bsd sed where
	  it's getting stuck in an infinite loop on daniel ro√überg's
	  unicode name. perl parses it fine so that'll do. also make the
	  script try a little harder to find the assignee by looking at the
	  line immediately following the current revision, in case someone
	  updates the authors as a separate commit from the description (as
	  was the case for 7.15).

2009-09-24 16:00  starseeker

	* [r36031] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch_brep.cpp:

2009-09-24 15:15  brlcad

2009-09-23 23:52  brlcad

	* [r36020] BUGS:
	  the fb-png gamma correction 'bug' turns out to not be a bug after
	  all, just a bad default gamma value coupled with an undocumented
	  command-line option. either way, it's changed/fixed now that no
	  gAMA chunk is getting written by default.

2009-09-23 23:49  brlcad

	* [r36019] NEWS, src/fb/fb-png.1, src/fb/fb-png.c:
	  default to no gamma correction, no gAMA chunk, so that the png
	  pixel values should match what was in the framebuffer. looks like
	  1.0 is overpowered for mac, 0.6 is closer but still slightly too
	  bright. turning the chunk off gives correct pixel values. turns
	  out the -g option was never documented either, so document it
	  along with the new info. this should reduce surprises due to
	  unexpected color shifts in output images.

2009-09-23 23:46  brlcad

	* [r36018] src/util:

2009-09-23 23:40  brlcad

	* [r36017] NEWS, src/util/pix-png.1, src/util/pix-png.c:
	  add a -g gamma correction option to pix-png similar to fb-png so
	  that a user can override and specify a desired gamma value.
	  change the default behavior from writing out a hard-coded 0.6
	  gamma value to instead not write out any gAMA chunk information
	  (via a default negative value). this lets it display the same
	  intensity pixel values on a host system as the originating pix
	  data and avoids the (semi-arbitrary) 0.6 magic value that 'does
	  not quite match..'

2009-09-23 23:35  starseeker

	* [r36016] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch_brep.cpp:
	  Not correct, but the error distance changed so it's clear that

2009-09-23 23:21  brlcad

	* [r36015] src/conv/dem-g.c:
	  eliminate the mk_dsp2() stub by just calling mk_dsp() now that it

	* [r36011] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch_brep.cpp:
	  OK, progress (sort of) - it wasn't edge creation, but a
	  disconnect between edge and 3d curve selection. Now the complaint
	  is m_T[0] being different from the start of the 3d curve.

2009-09-23 21:51  starseeker

	* [r36010] src/librt/primitives/sketch/sketch_brep.cpp:

	  proe seems to be spitting out left-hand rule triangles (i.e.

	  count...

2009-08-27 13:05  irpguardian

	* [r35725] src/libged/human.c:
	  Fixed bug where '-n' command didn't properly rename toplevel
	  combination.

2009-08-26 22:06  irpguardian

	  Various changes to reflect new verbose setting

2009-08-26 12:58  jdoliner

	* [r35714] src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.cpp,
	  src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.h:

2009-08-26 01:47  starseeker

	* [r35711] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_brep.cpp:

2009-08-25 14:53  irpguardian

	* [r35704] src/libged/human.c:
	  Added a new function which dumps out all measurements to a

2009-08-21 20:10  irpguardian

	* [r35678] src/libged/human.c:
	  Reworking Bounding Box problem, added debugger bones as

	  Mass expansion on the various documents we need including basic

	  conversion, and website synchronization.

2009-08-20 20:59  n_reed

	* [r35670] src/libdm/dm-rtgl.c:

2009-08-20 20:43  irpguardian

2009-08-20 16:40  brlcad

	* [r35663] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  really crude initial support for antialiasing. there are
	  currently two horribly inefficient methods, including one that
	  doesn't even really work yet. the one that doesn't work, uses 4x4
	  sub-pixel sampling to determine edge contributions within that
	  cell. the one that does work (poorly) only compares a local
	  sub-sample to the neighboring full-sample pixel cells. they're
	  horribly inefficient as they merely shoot additional rays to
	  determine that cell's intensity contribution.

2009-08-20 16:01  brlcad

	* [r35662] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  restructure file to avoid all the forward declaration function
	  prototypes

2009-08-20 15:56  brlcad

	* [r35661] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  add support for intensity mapping, albeit unused, as well
	  choosing colors based on both sides of the edge (might not be a
	  good idea).

2009-08-20 15:53  starseeker

	* [r35660] src/librt/primitives/arb8/arb8_brep.cpp,
	  src/proc-db/csgbrep.cpp:
	  at least arb8 brep generates something that can be raytraced

2009-08-20 15:48  brlcad

	* [r35659] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  implement the both_sides option, highlighting both sides of an
	  edge instead of just the left/top side. this gives a nice
	  double-thick aliased edge.

2009-08-20 15:42  brlcad

	* [r35658] src/rt/viewedge.c:
	  merge in the beginnings of basic antialias support. stub out
	  support to check all cardinal edges (not just up and left) as
	  well as intensity mapping. no functional change just yet.

2009-08-20 15:11  bob1961

	* [r35657] src/tclscripts/archer/Makefile.am,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/Utility.tcl,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/tclIndex:
	  Added the Utility class. Not much here yet. At the moment it
	  simply provides a class for Utility plugins to inherit from.

	* [r35656] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/HumanWizard.tcl,

2009-08-20 13:27  brlcad

2009-08-14 18:55  starseeker

	* [r35554] src/proc-db/Makefile.am, src/proc-db/csgbrep.cpp:
	  Add the skeleton for a csgbrep proc-db - eventually this will be
	  used to do examples of all of the primitives going from an
	  implicit to a NURBS representation. At the moment it looks like
	  the ability to do this is not yet set up, so need to wire in the

2009-08-14 15:14  brlcad

	* [r35533] src/proc-db/brep_cube.cpp,
	  src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.cpp, src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.h:
	  Adds a new class to keep track of intersections between
	  ON_BrepFaces. These classes record the intersection curves,
	  segment the curves based on the trimming curves of the faces they
	  came from, and slates the trim curves that got intersected for
	  destruction. Also adds in the functionality needed to sort curves
	  by start and end point and so that they can be matched and
	  reconstructed in to trims.

2009-08-01 23:35  brlcad

	* [r35426] src/other/Makefile.am:
	  don't even attempt to build tkhtml3 if documentation is disabled.
	  this makes the newish 'man' mged command not work, of course. if
	  it is enabled, though, make sure tkhtml3's build system links
	  against X_LIBS in order to fix a Mac compilation failure when
	  linking against system frameworks.

2009-08-01 23:27  brlcad

	* [r35425] configure.ac:
	  look just a little bit harder for X11 headers since mac os x
	  (10.4) seems to be intermittently setting ac_x_header_dirs to
	  empty yet ac_x_libraries non-empty. X_CFLAGS seems to be no
	  longer used so remove it.

2009-08-01 04:05  brlcad

	* [r35424] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard.tcl,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/HumanWizard.tcl,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/_HumanWizard.tcl:
	  fix filename case. class files should match their class and it's
	  nice to not have two identically named tcl files.

2009-08-01 04:03  brlcad

	* [r35423] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/_HumanWizard.tcl,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/humanwizard.tcl:
	  temporary rename to fix filename case.

2009-08-01 04:02  brlcad

	* [r35422] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard.tcl,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/humanwizard.tcl:
	  case consistency. class names are capitalized, CamelCase should
	  be consistent.

2009-08-01 03:55  brlcad

	* [r35421] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/Makefile:
	  remove generated file

2009-08-01 03:47  brlcad

	* [r35420] configure.ac, m4/cache.m4:
	  add a BC_CONFIG_COMPLETE macro that is used in conjunction with
	  BC_CONFIG_CACHE to let it know that configure completed
	  successfully. BC_CONFIG_COMPLETE must be called before AC_OUTPUT
	  because it sets a cache value that is read looked for during the
	  next run. this implements sf feature request 2828793 from
	  matt_chan (RFE: delete configure cache on failed run).

2009-08-01 03:42  brlcad

	* [r35419] src/mged/dozoom.c:
	  have to wrap the dm-rtgl code in DM_RTGL so we don't end up with
	  gl/glx header errors when opengl is disabled.

2009-08-01 03:03  starseeker

	* [r35418] src/conv/3dm/3dm-g.cpp:
	  Add notes on where to go looking for color, visibility, etc.
	  information needed to intelligently assign such settings during a
	  3dm import. Shouldn't be too hard to chase down.

2009-07-31 21:28  indianlarry

	* [r35417] configure.ac:
	  Added humans to top of food chain (added humanwizard to
	  configure.ac) ;^)

2009-07-31 17:59  irpguardian

	* [r35415] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/Makefile:
	  Added human wizard to list of buildable wizards in makefile

2009-07-31 17:04  irpguardian

	* [r35414] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/humanwizard.tcl:
	  Changed all variables to be for humans instead of tires

2009-07-31 15:41  irpguardian

	* [r35413] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard.tcl:
	  Changed file to match with tirewizard and tankwizard in format

2009-07-31 15:39  irpguardian

	* [r35412] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/Makefile.am,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard/humanwizard.tcl:
	  Added files needed for archer wizard on human geometry

2009-07-31 15:12  irpguardian

	* [r35411] src/archer/plugins/Wizards/Makefile.am,
	  src/archer/plugins/Wizards/humanwizard.tcl:
	  Started work on archer plugin for procedural human geometry

2009-07-30 21:28  bob1961

	* [r35410] src/libged/copyeval.c:
	  The copyeval command has been modified to do a regular copy if
	  the path_to_old_prim has a single path element (i.e. just a plain
	  object name).

2009-07-30 21:03  n_reed

	* [r35409] src/libdm/dm-rtgl.c:
	  using window size for gridding; experimenting with shot patterns

2009-07-30 20:04  bob1961

	* [r35408] src/libged/copy.c, src/libtclcad/ged_obj.c,
	  src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	  Added copyeval and facetize to Archer's undo framework.

2009-07-30 19:41  bob1961

	* [r35407] src/libged/copyeval.c:
	  Changed the order of the arguments (i.e. path_to_old_prim comes
	  before new_prim). Removed the option to specify the path elements
	  individually (i.e. "all.g box.r box.s" is no longer allowed. One
	  must instead specify it as all.g/box.r/box.s).

2009-07-30 17:04  jdoliner

	* [r35406] src/proc-db/surfaceintersect.cpp:
	  Chased down a couple of bugs, intersection now runs succussfully
	  on two intersecting nurbs surfaces

	* [r35381] src/conv/3dm/3dm-g.cpp:
	  Few more formatting tweaks in debug output of 3dm-g. Names such

	  add a proper --enable-rtgl flag to configure that will
	  enable/disable compilation of the new rtgl dm interface. it's
	  still tied to opengl (which is presently defaulted off), so you
	  have to specify --with-opengl too. intentionally did not assign
	  aliases or add to enable-all as a) it's still under development,
	  b) it needs more work at least to not hang drawing, and c) there

	  Ah. Need to subdivide even flat nurbs surfaces in order to assign
	  small subsets of the trimming curves to small areas of the nurbs
	  surface for evaluation purposes. I wonder, would it be 'cleaner',
	  in cases like this, to do some sort of test of points against the
	  curve tree? i.e. for a uv point, if inside the uv bounds of a
	  node, find subnodes that it is inside of, repeat until leaf
	  node(s) are found, then work on the leaf nodes? Probably more
	  expensive for a trimming test, but avoids breaking up flat
	  surfaces.

	  Ah HAH. Fix the flatness test to use corner and interior points
	  the way the old setup did (even though the interior points are a
	  bit different.) Appears to fix the visual flaws from the default

2009-07-13 20:10  irpguardian

	* [r35097] src/proc-db/human.c:
	  Completly redone all functions to take human data structure, as

	  However, currently does not build anything, as it bus-fails when

	  reported by Jeff Meldrum (jspaces) regarding a const to non-const
	  conversion. according to a handful of online sources, c++
	  apparently changes the signature of strrchr from the posix C decl

2009-07-10 19:02  irpguardian

	  with indianlarry and this approach is not yet functional,
	  sticking it into two temporary files that are EXTRA_DISTed. Once

	  that both the X and ogl display managers had the same bug, now
	  fixed to make the buffer dynamic based on the number of visuals
	  detected as available (from XGetVisualInfo). got rid of some dead
	  code and stereo conditionals while we're in here so we can
	  simplify the logic. this fixes the crash and should scale to
	  insane visual counts (worth noting that mac os x 10.5 seems to be
	  the only platform that provoked this bug with large number of
	  visuals (800+).

2009-06-23 14:01  irpguardian

	* [r34849] src/proc-db/human.c:
	  Made significant updates to the human.c file which will
	  eventually be a complete human generator that
	  uses CSG to model a human.
	  
	  human.c currently creates a 'stick' human to a desired height by
	  use of command line parameters and also
	  allows for the output of specifically named .g file when using
	  the -o command on input.
	  Also included are most of the bounding blocked for each part of
	  the generated body by using the -b command.
	  So if you wanted to make a 'human' right now, the command would
	  be...
	  ./human -H60 -o man.g -b
	  And that would generate a 60 inch tall stick figure named man.g
	  with bounding boxes.
	  the -? and -h commands bring up the help if needed
	  
	  As for the code itself, each part of the person is divded up into
	  its own function which creates that
	  part. So there is a makeHead which makes the head, a makeLeftFoot
	  which makes the left foot and so on.
	  All funtions are controlled by the makeBody funtion which holds
	  all relevant values to be sent to each
	  part funtion, and makeBody is called by main and is sent the
	  values for the standing height of the person,
	  and whether there should be bounding boxes included.

	  change in the UV horizontal(v) but as discussed that should be an

	  we can cheat and fake the dependency resolve by letting

	* [r34604] src/libfb/if_X24.c:
	  the X24_blit() logic is still wacky for zoomed windows but this
	  change does stop the invalid memory access crashes that were
	  occuring for small renderings (that had large zooms) during
	  memcpy. the line-duplication logic was copying from the middle of
	  a line for the length of a line, which is only valid from the

	  need to visualize material thickness as an intensity value (akin

	* [r34543] src/libdm/dm-X.c:
	  reports of a crash on Mac OS X from 'irocha' on the brl-cad help
	  forum with a reported crash trace leading to the DisplayWidth()
	  call. this would seem to imply that there is a display without a
	  default screen and (more specific to the crash) that
	  DefaultScreen() is a null pointer. so we check it. if it is
	  indeed null, try to create or request the screen associated with
	  the window we created.

	* [r34527] TODO:
	  search needs some sort of -param option to inquire about specific

	* [r34526] src/tclscripts/mged/Makefile.am,
	  src/tclscripts/mged/bots.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/tclIndex:
	  add the 'bots' command (along with 'per_line') to mged for
	  finding specific kinds of bots in an open database as a short
	  term replacement until 'search' can do it better. make the
	  commands already deprecated so they can be removed at will when

	  we are tagged and distcheck passes so bump version up to 7.14.9

	* [r34513] src/librt/bundle.c, src/librt/shoot.c,
	  src/librt/vshoot.c:
	  allow null a_hit/a_miss callbacks in the application structure so
	  that the caller doesn't have to provide empty/stubbed callback
	  functions just to prevent a crash.

2009-05-12 06:54  d_rossberg

	  odd ws snuckage

2009-05-11 20:17  brlcad

	* [r34493] configure.ac:
	  all -build options should default to 'auto', including step. if
	  the user specifically requested step and parser/lexer aren't
	  present, abort.

2009-05-11 19:54  brlcad

	* [r34492] configure.ac:
	  need to force compilation of step off if there are no
	  parsers/lexers found since there is a parser in libexpress.
	  avoids compile-time failure on minimal systems.

2009-05-11 19:25  bob1961

	  Included rtgeom.h in ged_private.h, modified the signatures of
	  ged_scale_ell() and ged_scale_tor() (i.e. removed matp_t
	  parameter). Also fixed pscale (it wasn't working when matrices
	  were found along the path).
