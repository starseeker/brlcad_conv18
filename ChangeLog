	* [r44708] README, include/conf/MINOR, include/conf/PATCH:
	  Here we got - bump the version numbers.

2011-05-27 22:07  starseeker

	* [r44707] doc/deprecation.txt:
	  Abrupt, but close to minimal and what appears to be the least
	  painful way forward - mro is going, all hail
	  bu_attribute_value_set.

2011-05-27 20:32  r_weiss

	* [r44706] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_bool.c:
	  Corrected logic in functions 'nmg_booltree_evaluate' and
	  'nmg_boolean' within file 'nmg_bool.c'. This fix stops the error
	  'nmg_boolean() result of nmg_booltree_evaluate() isn't tp' which
	  occurs occasionally when performing nmg boolean operations such
	  as when using the mged 'facetize' command. This change also
	  allows boolean operations to return a null result without
	  failing.

2011-05-26 20:38  bob1961

	* [r44700] src/other/iwidgets/generic/fileselectionbox.itk,
	  src/other/iwidgets/generic/fileselectiondialog.itk,
	  src/other/iwidgets/generic/scrolledlistbox.itk,
	  src/other/iwidgets/generic/scrolledtext.itk:
	  Temporarily deleted a few troublesome options that currently
	  break things like iwidgets::fileselectionbox and rtwizard. Need
	  to find out what's really going on here.

2011-05-26 18:05  starseeker

	* [r44699] src/librt/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Use the same trick for librt as librt-static - Wno-error due to
	  Mac OSX warning

2011-05-26 18:04  erikgreenwald

	* [r44698] include/config_win_cmake.h:
	  remove duplicate WITH_TK definition

2011-05-26 15:13  erikgreenwald

	* [r44697] src/proc-db/ringworld.c:
	  remove 'count' check, since that doesn't exist.

2011-05-26 11:39  erikgreenwald

	* [r44696] src/proc-db/CMakeLists.txt, src/proc-db/Makefile.am,
	  src/proc-db/ringworld.c:
	  Stub Niven's "ringworld" structure as a proc-db. It'd be an
	  awesome stress test.

2011-05-25 19:02  starseeker

	* [r44691] src/tclscripts/rtwizard/rtwizard.tcl:
	  Make rtwizard's dirname line match archer's...

2011-05-24 20:24  starseeker

	* [r44674] src/adrt/isst_tcltk.c:
	  Use TIE_EXPORT instead of manually calling out the _declspec
	  statements in the .c file (VS2010 Express doesn't seem to like
	  that...)

2011-05-24 15:43  r_weiss

	* [r44657] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_pt_fu.c:
	  Updated functions 'compute_loop_class' and 'make_near_list'
	  within file 'nmg_pt_fu.c'. Passed bn_tol into function
	  'make_near_list' to be used in a compare. This change reduces the
	  number of 'dangling face' errors during nmg boolean operations
	  such as when running the mged 'facetize' command.

2011-05-24 14:43  starseeker

	* [r44656] src/fb/CMakeLists.txt, src/util/CMakeLists.txt:

	* [r44653] src/librt/tree.c:
	  OK, .g file with bad attributes was causing problems - revert
	  silly hunt for region in path.

2011-05-20 18:52  starseeker

	* [r44650] src/librt/db_tree.c, src/librt/tree.c:
	  Try to make sure the comb data structure reflects the attributes.

2011-05-20 18:31  starseeker

	* [r44649] src/librt/tree.c:
	  Well... grab the attributes from the first region in the path and
	  use them... does this get us what we need?

2011-05-20 17:37  starseeker

	* [r44648] src/librt/tree.c:
	  Hrm. Don't want to do a straight-up copy if the tree avs - that's
	  got NULLs, not actual values. Probably need to pull in the
	  attributes from elsewhere, but this isn't quite right - it's
	  looking at primitives and the attributes in question appear to be
	  higher in the path.

2011-05-20 17:31  starseeker

	* [r44647] src/libged/attr.c:
	  attr get and show should work in read-only databases - it's only
	  when we actually try to change something that we need to care
	  about read-only.

2011-05-20 15:19  erikgreenwald

	* [r44646] TODO:
	  solids regression fails on optimized builds and goes back quite a

2011-05-20 13:18  bob1961

	* [r44645] src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	  Copy points/vectors to an array of GLdouble before sending to
	  OpenGL. This seems to have remedied a bit of strange behavior
	  seen only on windows (i.e. data arrows were sometimes being drawn
	  incorrectly).

2011-05-20 13:13  bob1961

	* [r44644] src/libdm/dm-ogl.c:
	  Minor mod.

	  src/librt/prep.c, src/librt/tree.c, src/librtserver/rtserver.c,
	  src/nirt/if.c, src/rt/rtshot.c:
	  Take a stab at switching from bu_mro (??) to
	  bu_attribute_value_set - this will need a lot more testing
	  (certainly of nirt and raytracing) to make sure nothing got
	  busted.

2011-05-19 22:19  starseeker

	* [r44638] CMakeLists.txt:
	  Maybe someday this will work, or I'll figure out why I'm doing it
	  wrong - CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH should be ideal for excluding
	  the install dir from Find results, but it doesn't seem to.

2011-05-18 16:58  indianlarry

	* [r44629] src/conv/step/EdgeCurve.cpp,

	  Generalized curve generation for the ellipse and circle entity
	  loadBrep code; also added curve reverse and start/stop point swap
	  for entity 'edge_curve' based on 'same_sense' boolean variable.
	  This basically fixed some issues with ellipse and circle conics.

	* [r44528] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_fuse.c:

	  'nmg_two_face_fuse' and 'nmg_ck_fu_verts' within file
	  'nmg_fuse.c'. For function 'nmg_do_radial_join', changed tests
	  for greater-than or less-than '0.0' to comparing with
	  SMALL_FASTF. For function 'nmg_radial_build_list', changed
	  several float compares using equal to use ZERO macro. Added test
	  for return value from function 'nmg_measure_fu_angle' being
	  out-of-range. Added test for zero magnitude of xvec, yvec and
	  zvec vectors. For function 'nmg_two_face_fuse', changed tests for
	  greater-than or less-than '0.0' to comparing with SMALL_FASTF.
	  For function 'nmg_ck_fu_verts', changed code to use 'fabs' to
	  find the absolute value instead of negating the value if less
	  than zero.

2011-04-27 17:38  r_weiss

	* [r44527] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_tri.c:
	  Updated the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'
	  doing some cleanup and re-factoring. The re-factoring created
	  function 'nmg_isect_lseg3_eu' to test if a line segment
	  intersects with any edgeuse within a faceuse. Updated the
	  function 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse' adding code to verify
	  each loopuse has at least 3 unique vertices. The functions
	  'nmg_isect_lseg3_eu' and 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse'
	  support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg
	  triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added so these
	  updates/additions are disabled by default. This code is a work in
	  progress.

2011-04-27 16:46  r_weiss

	* [r44525] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_class.c:
	  Updated functions 'nmg_class_pt_e', 'nmg_2lu_identical',
	  'class_shared_lu' and 'nmg_classify_lu_lu' within file
	  'nmg_class.c'. Changes were made to compare against SMALL_FASTF
	  instead of '0.0'.

2011-04-27 15:03  r_weiss

	* [r44524] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_bool.c:
	  Updated function 'nmg_bool' within file 'nmg_bool.c'. Moved this
	  change from the triangulation prototype code to the main code.
	  This change corrects a corruption problem with the class list
	  array. This will improve the sucess of boolean operations on
	  facetized cgs geometry.

2011-04-27 14:51  r_weiss

	* [r44522] src/librt/primitives/nmg/nmg_manif.c:
	  Updated functions 'paint_face' and 'nmg_shell_manifolds' within
	  file 'nmg_manif.c'. There was a datatype mismatch in the function
	  parameters and some array datatypes were incorrect and there size
	  was incorrect. This fix stops a seg fault when running facetize
	  on large models. This also improves the boolean operations of
	  facetized cgs geometry.

	* [r44488] misc/CMake/BRLCAD_CheckFunctions.cmake:
	  Whoops, spoke too soon on CMake macro behavior. Looks like it may
	  actually be another consequence of loading src/other prior to
	  processing toplevel settings - .cmake files with conflicting
	  definitions for macros in src/other will be loaded first.

2011-04-25 17:45  starseeker

	* [r44487] CMakeLists.txt, misc/CMake/BRLCAD_CheckFunctions.cmake,
	  src/libtclcad/CMakeLists.txt, src/other/CMakeLists.txt:
	  Ah, interesting. There is a subtle point with the CMake macros
	  that hadn't previously been triggered - if a subdirectory build
	  runs a macro, a parent directory will not re-run that macro.
	  Makes sense if the macros only job is to set CMake variables -
	  we're doing more by having the macro write out to a config file.
	  As a consequence, when a subconfigure uses a macro that puts an
	  entry into CONFIG_H in a subdir, the parent directory won't be
	  able to run that macro. Need to refactor to do this right - the
	  building of the various CONFIG_H files needs to be explicit and
	  not contained in macro calls.

	  increment axis AFTER the end of the loop, not as the first

	  YZXYZXYZX. this unfortunately may impact selection results for
	  MUVES and other overlap handlers (once again), but it's more

	  'plane.c' within the libbn library. This is a prototype version
	  of the function 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3'. Preprocessor commands
	  were added so this prototype version is disabled by default. The
	  bug was when line segments are colinear, dist[1] returned from
	  this function has an alternate meaning, it is the distance along
	  the 'p' line segment (not 'q') therefore it must be scaled by the
	  magnitude of the 'p' line segment (i.e. pmag), not the magnitude
	  of the 'q' line segment. Added/updated/moved bu_log messages for
	  debugging, added/updated comments. This prototype function
	  supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg

	* [r44312] src/libged/red.c:
	  blather a strong warning since several data-destructive bugs are
