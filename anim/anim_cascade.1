.TH ANIM_CASCADE 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
anim_cascade - evaluate movement of an object relative to a moving frame of
reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anim_cascade [-s][-o(f|r|a)] [-(f|r|a)(c|y) # # #] <
.B input.table >
.B output.table
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Anim_cascade
is designed to enable the user to control the movement of objects relative to
other objects. In the normal mode of operation, the user supplies
the position and orientation of a (possibly moving) frame of reference and 
the position 
and orientation of an object relative to the frame of reference,
and 
.I anim_cascade
produces the absolute position and orientation of the object at each
point in time.
All orientations are specified as yaw, pitch, and roll.
The columns of the input table are:

time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll

and the columns of the output table are:

time ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll

Here "f" refers to the frame of reference, "r" refers to the position
and orientation of the object relative to the frame, and "a"
refers to the absolute position and orientation of the object.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B \-or 
Output the relative position and orientation. 
If this option is specified, 
.I anim_cascade
will expect the absolute position and orientation of the frame of
reference and the object as input, 
and will produce the position and orientation or the object relative to
the frame as output. The
input columns should be:

time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll

and the output columns will be:

time rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll

.TP 
.B \-of
Output the frame of reference.
If this option is specified, 
.I anim_cascade
will expect the absolute and relative positions and orientations of the
object as input, 
and will produce the corresponding frame of reference as output.
The input columns should be:

time ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll

and the output columns will be:

time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll

.TP 
.B \-fc # # #
Specify a constant position for the frame of reference. The
columns fx, fy, and fz should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead. 
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with 
.B -of
.TP 
.B \-fy # # #
Specify a constant orientation for the frame of reference. The
columns fyaw, fpitch, and froll should be omitted from the input table, 
and the command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with 
.BR -of .
.TP 
.B \-rc # # #
Specify a constant position of the object relative to the frame
of reference. The 
columns rx, ry, and rz should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with 
.BR -or .
.TP 
.B \-ry # # #
Specify a constant orientation of the object relative to the 
frame of reference. The
columns ryaw,  rpitch, and rroll should be omitted from the input table, 
and the command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with 
.BR -or .
.TP 
.B \-ac # # #
Specify a constant absolute position for the object. The 
columns ax, ay, and az should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect unless used 
in conjunction with 
.B -or
or
.BR -of .
.TP 
.B \-ay # # #
Specify a constant absolute orientation for the object. The
columns ayaw, apitch, and aroll should be omitted from the input table, 
and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect unless used 
in conjunction with 
.B -or
or 
.BR -of .
.TP
.B \-s
Suppress time column. No time column is read or written. 

Note: When all of the input columns are specified with command-line arguments,
then standard input is not read and
only one line of output is produced. The time value will be set to zero,
unless it is suppressed.

.SH EXAMPLES
1. Suppose that you want to survey a moving object with the virtual camera.
There should already exist an animation table with the time, position,
and orientation of the object in each frame. This will be the moving
frame of reference. Next, decide what position
and orientation the camera should have relative to the object in each
frame and append these columns (using 
.IR paste , 
for example), to create the
input table. 
.I Anim_cascade 
will produce an absolute animation table for
the camera, suitable to use as input to 
.IR anim_script :

anim_cascade < input.table | anim_script -v500 > view.script

2. Suppose that you have an animation path for an object and you want to
know when it crosses a given oblique plane. You can use the 
.B -or 
option to
find out what the position of the object is relative to the frame of
reference of the plane. Suppose that the plane is defined by the
equation:

 x + z = 0

In a frame of reference located at the origin with a pitch of 45
degrees, the x-axis is perpendicular to the given plane.
To convert the absolute animation path into this frame of reference, the command
would be:

anim_cascade -or -fc 0 0 0 -fy 0 45 0 < absolute.table > relative.table

Wherever the x coordinate in the output table is positive, the object
lies above the plane.

3. Suppose that one object is situated at the point (1,2,3) with a yaw,
pitch, and roll of (45, 25, 10). Suppose further that you want to
position a camera so that to the camera, the first object seems to be 10
units straight ahead, facing to the right. You could find the required
position and orientation of the camera with the following command:

anim_cascade -s -of -ac 1 2 3 -ay 45 25 10 -rc 10 0 0 -ry -90 0 0
