To compile and install the BRLCAD source, perform the following steps:

	% mkdir /usr/brlcad

If you choose a directory other than /usr/brlcad, you will need to set the
environment variable BRLCAD_ROOT to be the name of this directory.  Because a
number of paths are compiled into the package, it is not possible to compile
the package for one location, then move it to another.  Be sure that
/usr/brlcad/bin or $BRLCAD_ROOT/bin is in your shell path.  For example:

	sh:
		BRLCAD_ROOT=/foobar/brlcad 
		PATH=$PATH:/foobar/brlcad/bin
		export PATH
	csh:
	 	setenv BRLCAD_ROOT /foobar/brlcad
	 	set path=($path /foobar/brlcad/bin)

Compile:
	% cd /foobar/brlcad
	% sh setup.sh

	The next step can take a considerable amount of time on some systems:
	
	sh:
		make > make.log 2>&1
	csh:
		make >& make.log

Install:
	Review the log of compilation, then run:

		make install

This process should proceed without problems on the following systems:

	RedHat Linux 7.2
	FreeBSD 4.5
	SunOS 5.8 (Solaris)
	Irix 6.5
	Mac OS X (With X11 installed -- see notes below)

Max OS X Installation Notes:

Being that this is the newest architecture to be added, there are some
issues to keep in mind with the installation when building from source.
First, XFree86 will need to be installed if you want a gui.  The XDarwin
project will include the X11 libraries and headers necessary to properly
build Tk (the only component that presently "requires" X) and may be
found at:

	http://www.xdarwin.org

To build and install, the instructions above will all work with the
exception of the "make install" step.  Run this instead:

	cake install

If the build and install fails for whatever reason (i.e. if after
building and installing, mged doesn't start properly when you type 
'mged"), then the system default Tcl library is most likely getting
in the way.  You can temporarily move it out of the way by doing:

	sudo mv /usr/lib/libtcl.dylib /usr/lib/libtcl.dylib.backup
	sudo mv /usr/lib/libtcl8.3.dylib /usr/lib/libtcl8.3.dylib.backup
	sudo mv /usr/lib/libtclstub8.3.a /usr/lib/libtclstub8.3.a.backup
	sudo mv /System/Library/Tcl /System/Library/Tcl.backup

Then you should be able to do:

	cake clobber
	cake
	cake install

Happy installation!
