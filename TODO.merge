This branch contains a significant rework of the libdm/libfb libraries, merging
them into a single libdm and converting the platform-specific display backends
into dynamically loaded plugins.

In order to successfully merge this back into the mainline BRL-CAD, correct
functionality will need to be verified for:

Any tools using the fb2pix, pix2fb, fbclear, and png2fb libged functions.

Any tools displaying a libdm or libfb window, especially within their own framework (Java, Qt, etc.)
