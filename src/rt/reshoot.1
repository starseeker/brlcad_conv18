.SH NAME
reshoot \- re-shoot rays and compare results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reshoot
model.g objects ... < raylist
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is designed to shoot a set of rays and compare the results with previous results.
The program exits with a non-zero status if any rays are different from the previous run, 
and a 0 status if no differences were found.
.P
Typically, an application (probably other than 
.I reshoot\fR)
is run with the RT_G_DEBUG flag DEBUG_ALLHITS set.
This will cause librt to log all calls to the application \fIhit\fR routine to the standard error.
The logged output can be processed by an 
.I awk 
program to produce input to 
.I reshoot\fR.
Consider the file p.awk with the following contents:
.P
.nf
/Pnt/ { START=index($0,"(") + 1
       STR=substr($0, START, index($0,")") - START)
       gsub(  ", "  , "," , STR)
       printf "Pnt=%s\n",STR
       }
/Dir/ { START=index($0,"(") + 1
       STR=substr($0, START, index($0,")") - START)
       gsub(  ", "  , "," , STR)
       printf "Dir=%s\n",STR
       }
/PT/  { PARTIN=$3; PARTOUT=$5 }
/InHIT/ { INHIT=$2 }
/OutHIT/ { OUTHIT=$2 }
/Region/ { printf "\tregion=%s in=%s in%s out=%s out%s\n",$2,PARTIN,INHIT,PARTOUT,OUTHIT}
.fi
.P
Given this 
.I awk 
program The log file from the application can be processed as follows:
.IP
awk -f p.awk < logfile > shotlist
.P
to produce input for 
.I reshoot\fR.
Then 
.I reshoot
can be run as follows:
.IP
reshoot geom.g obj ... < shotlist
