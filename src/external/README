Contained in this directory are codes that are written to work with
and/or link against external packages.  These codes are often written
as plugins, modules, or libraries to to some external package and
generally may not even attempt to compile if the optional codes are
not enabled during configure.  Even after being enabled, some manual
setup may be required so that these codes may find requisite external
headers or libraries that are needed for compilation.

	This code is a Pro/Engineer exporter plugin module intended to
be used directly within the Pro/Engineer environment (e.g. Wildfire).
