/** @file pc_solver.c
 *
 *  Library for writing MGED databases from arbitrary procedures.
 *  Assumes that some of the structure of such databases are known
 *  by the calling routines.
 *
 *  It is expected that this library will grow as experience is gained.
 *  Routines for writing every permissible solid do not yet exist.
 *
 *  Note that routines which are passed point_t or vect_t or mat_t
 *  parameters (which are call-by-address) must be VERY careful to
 *  leave those parameters unmodified (eg, by scaling), so that the
 *  calling routine is not surprised.
 *
 *  Return codes of 0 are OK, -1 signal an error.
