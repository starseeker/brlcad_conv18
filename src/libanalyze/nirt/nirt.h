/**
 * Design thoughts for nirt diffing:
 *
 * NIRT difference events come in two primary forms: "transition" differences
 * in the form of entry/exit hits, and differences in segments - the regions
 * between transitions.  In the context of a diff, a segment by definition
 * contains no transitions on *either* shotline path.  Even if a segment
 * contains no transitions along its own shotline, if a transition from the
 * other shot falls within its bounds the original segment will be treated as
 * two sequential segments of the same type for the purposes of comparison.
 *
 * Transitions are compared only to other transitions, and segments are
 * compared only to other segments.
 *
 * The comparison criteria are as follows:
 *
 * Transition points:
 *
 * 1.  DIST_PNT_PNT - if there is a transition on either path that does not align
 *     within the specified distance tolerance with a transition on the other
 *     path, the transition is unmatched and reported as a difference.
 * 2.  Obliquity delta - if two transition points align within the distance
 *     tolerance, the next test is the difference between their normals. If
 *     these match in direction and obliquity angle, the transition points
 *     are deemed to be matching.  Otherwise, a difference is reported on the
 *     transition point.
 *
 * Segments:
 *
 * 1.  The first comparison made between segments is their type. Type
 *     differences will always be reported as a difference.
 *
 * 2.  If types match, behavior will depend on options and the specific
 *     types being compared:
 *
 *     GAPS:       always match.
 *
 *     PARTITIONS: Match if all active criteria match.  If no criteria
 *                 are active, match.  Possible active criteria:
 *
 *                 Region name
 *                 Path name
 *                 Region ID
 *
 *     OVERLAPS:   Match if all active criteria match.  If no criteria
 *                 are active, match.  Possible active criteria:
 *                 
 *                 Overlap region set
 *                 Overlap path set
 *                 Overlap region id set
 *                 Selected "winning" partition in the overlap
