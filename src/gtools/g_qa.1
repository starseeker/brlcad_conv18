.TH G_QA 1
.SH NAME
g_qa \- a BRL-CAD geometry analysis tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "g_qa " "[optoins] model.g objects"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I g_qa 
program computes weights, volumes and detects overlaps in geometric descriptions.
The 
.I objects
specified are analyzed.
It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions.  
The grid is progressively refined until the answers from all three grid calculations agree 
within a given tolerance.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a analysis_flags
Specifies which computations are to be performed.  The parameter is one or more of the following:
.B a, o, w, v,
for 
.I all, overlaps, weight
and 
.I volume 
respectively.  Only those reports requested will be provided.  The default is 
.I all.
.TP
.B \-f filename
Specifies that density values should be taken from an external file instead of from the _DENSITIES object in the database.
.TP
.B -g gridsize

Specifies the spacing between rays in the grids.  The default value is
50.0mm or a minumum of 10 rays per axis of the bounding box of the
geometry.  For example, a geometry with a 10x10x10mm bounding box
would (by default) get a 1mm grid size.  If the user specifies a
value, it is used.  If that value does not guarantee 10 samples per
axis, a warning is printed.  If the user does not specify a grid size,
the program will set the grid size to asure 10 rays/axis.  The gridsize may be specified with units.  For example:
.B 5mm
or 
.B 10in.

.TP
.B \-P ncpu
Specifies that
.I ncpu
CPU's should be used for performing the caluclation.  Note that
specifying more cpus than are present on the machine does not increase
the number of computation threads.  By default, all local cpu's are
utilized.  This option exists primarily to reduce the number of
computation threads from the machine maximum.
.TP
.B \-t tolerance
Specifies a tolerance value which the 3 view computations must be within for computation to complete.  The default value is 0.5.

.TP
.B \-r
Specifies that per-region statistics about volume and weight are desired.

.TP
.B \-q
Specifies that the tolerance of at least 10 samples per axis be applied to the smallest region bounding box, not the model bounding box.  This results in much tighter grids, longer runtimes, and higher quality answers.
.TP
.B -m hits
Specifies that the grid be refined until each region has at least 
.I hits
ray intersections.

.SH EXAMPLES
.P
To compute the weight an volume of objects.
