/** @file scale_ehy.c
 *
 * The scale_ehy command.
 *
 * FIXME: This command really probably shouldn't exist.  The way MGED
 * currently handles scaling is to pass a transformation matrix to
 * transform_editing_solid(), which simply calls
 * rt_matrix_transform().  The primitives already know how to apply an
 * arbitrary matrix transform to their data making the need for
 * primitive-specific editing commands such as this one unnecessary.
