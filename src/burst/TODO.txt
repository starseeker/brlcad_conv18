The interactive mode had been removed from burst, but right now command
processing is tied up with the menu implementation - the menu init is setting
up the command evaluation mechanism, even for batch mode.

We need to migrate to a bu_cmdtab implemenation instead so we can clear out the
menu implementation code and generally make this easier to understand.
