  \brief Create a surface based on a subset of a parent surface

  Create a NURBS surface that corresponds to a subset
  of an input surface, as defined by UV intervals. The
  t parameters may be NULL, in which case working surfaces
  will be created by the function.  If supplied, existing 
  surfaces are reused to avoid extra malloc operations 
  and memory usage associated with creating the working
  surfaces.

  @param srf parent ON_Surface
  @param u_val U interval of proposed subsurface
  @param v_val V interval of proposed subsurface
  @param t1 surface used during split algorithm
  @param t2 surface used during split algorithm
  @param t3 surface used during split algorithm
  @param t4 surface used during split algorithm
  @param[out] result final subsurface

  @return @c true if surface creation is successful or if the subsurface
  is the same as the parent surface, @c false if one or more split
  operations failed.
