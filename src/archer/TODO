TODO List for integrating MGED features into Archer

Intended as a "list of work to be done" for porting MGED features to Archer.  The absence of a feature
does not necessarily mean it is intended that this feature be added, particularly for "minor" features
or features that are currently not working well in MGED to start with - these are primarily discussion
points.

Starting with a "walkthrough" of the MGED menu:

     MGED Feature                   |         Archer Status of Feature or Alternative to Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create New Database                 |                             DONE
Open Existing Database              |                             DONE (command line needs opendb)
Import Database	                    |    			  DONE (dbconcat available on command line)
Export Database                     |    			  DONE (keep available on command line)
Load Script                         |    			  DONE (source available on command line)
Raytrace Control Panel              |       			  DONE (some options in Preferences dialog, rest can be achieved using command line rt command)
Render View options                 |            PARTIAL - saveview, not sure about plot and postscript output
Preferences->Units                  |   			  DONE
Preferences->Command Line Edit      |                             DONE (in preferences panel)
Preferences->Special Characters     |    Refers to globbing - per Bob this is currently being handled per
				    |    command in Archer, so a global setting may not make sense.  A
				    |    possible alternative is to have two lists of commands - globbing
				    |    and non-globbing - and the ability to select and move them from
				    |    one list to the other (kind of like traditional ftp clients) in
				    |    a Preferences tab
Preferences->Colors                 |    	                  DONE (Handled in local per-topic preferences)
Preferences->Fonts                  |                    INCOMPLETE, lower priority
Create/Update .mgedrc               |                    INCOMPLETE - .archerrc exists, needs to be expanded as more preferences are implemented in Archer - ONGOING
Clear Command Window                |                             DONE (clear on command line)
Exit                                |                             DONE
Primitive Selection                 |                             DONE
Matrix Selection                    |                    NEED TO TEST 
				    |    Ensure working command line level functionality for direct matrix
				    |    manipulation if needed.  For items without a matrix show the tab with
				    |    either no values specified or the identity matrix as the starting
				    |    template.  Full functionality here will require "limited xpush"
				    |    abilities - xpushing only to a specified depth, and possibly some
				    |    awareness of full path targets vs. toplevel targets.
Primitive Editor                    |                             DONE (functionality covered elsewhere)
Combination Editor                  |                             DONE (more GUI work would be good, but basic features present)
Attribute Editor                    |                             DONE (can be done with attr command)
                                    |    This is a more general case of what is currently the General tab in
				    |    Archer for objects - make this into a CAD widget with the layout of
				    |    the General tab and the functionality of the Attribute editor -
				    |    General tab will become Attribute tab.  Will need to be able to
				    |    customize the standard attribute/value display to support things like
				    |    the color picker for rgb attribute
Geometry Browser                    |                             DONE (Archer tree view)
Create Primitives                   |                             DONE (drop-down in toolbar, need better icon) 
View                                |                             DONE (duplicated elsewhere)

	 Pick Edit Combination      |                             DONE (Replaced by combination of "component pick" button and tree widget)

Settings -> Transform               |    Angle/Distance Cursor not implemented yet - needs documentation as well

Other Issues
------------

* archer doesn't have the -c option to run command-line or sans Tk -  need to "port"
  archer to the C code startup that MGED uses - some preliminary work has been done,
  but needs to be made more robust and tested.

* add ability to undo transaction sets - long term feature that needs libged transactions mechanism

Tests to Pass
-------------

* The merged Archer/MGED app needs to be able to pass all the regression
  tests currently passed by MGED
