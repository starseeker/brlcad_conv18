TODO List for integrating MGED features into Archer

Intended as a "list of work to be done" for porting MGED features to Archer.  The absence of a feature
does not necessarily mean it is intended that this feature be added, particularly for "minor" features
or features that are currently not working well in MGED to start with - these are primarily discussion
points.

Starting with a "walkthrough" of the MGED menu:

     MGED Feature                   |         Archer Status of Feature or Alternative to Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Render View options                 |                    UNKNOWN - NEED TO TEST - saveview, not sure about plot and postscript output
Preferences->Fonts                  |                    INCOMPLETE, lower priority
Create/Update .mgedrc               |                    INCOMPLETE - .archerrc exists, needs to be expanded as more preferences are implemented in Archer - ONGOING
Matrix Selection                    |                    UNKNOWN - NEED TO TEST 
				    |    Ensure working command line level functionality for direct matrix
				    |    manipulation if needed.  For items without a matrix show the tab with
				    |    either no values specified or the identity matrix as the starting
				    |    template.  Full functionality here will require "limited xpush"
				    |    abilities - xpushing only to a specified depth, and possibly some
				    |    awareness of full path targets vs. toplevel targets.
Attribute Editor                    |                     DONE (can be done with attr command)
                                    |    This is a more general case of what is currently the General tab in
				    |    Archer for objects - make this into a CAD widget with the layout of
				    |    the General tab and the functionality of the Attribute editor -
				    |    General tab will become Attribute tab.  Will need to be able to
				    |    customize the standard attribute/value display to support things like
				    |    the color picker for rgb attribute
Sweep Zoom Rectangle                |                     INCOMPLETE - Need to see if this can be integrated as an option to the scale mode
Settings -> Constraint Coords.      |                     INCOMPLETE - This is worth preserving, but needs some though on how to integrate it.
Settings -> Rotate About            |                     INCOMPLETE - Save ability to rotate around view and maybe a specified keypoint to allow for flexibility
Settings -> Query Ray Effects       |                     INCOMPLETE - Will be handled elsewhere - nirt/query ray settings panel
Modes -> Display Manager            |                     INCOMPLETE - Archer is ogl only at the moment need to support other display managers and conditionalize the features that rely on OpenGL to only be active when ogl is.
Modes -> Rate Knobs                 |                     INCOMPLETE - Low priority
Tools -> ADC Control Panel          |                     INCOMPLETE - see if ADC gives us anything not provided by the measurement tool
Tools -> AnimMate                   |                     INCOMPLETE? - talk with Keith to see how he animated in Archer
Tools -> Query Ray                  |                     INCOMPLETE - convert to preferences tab or tool
Tools -> Build Pattern Tool         |                     INCOMPLETE - convert to Archer wizard
Tools -> Overlap Tool               |                     INCOMPLETE - expose in Archer as a tool
Tools -> Upgrade Database...        |                     INCOMPLETE - need dbupgrade on the command line?
Help -> Apropos                     |                     INCOMPLETE, not working well in MGED either?


Other Issues
------------

* raytrace button won't abort correctly due to using rtwizard rather than rt directly - will probably need fixes to rtwizard and archer

* need proper "raytrace control" panel for easy access to raytracer options



Long Term
---------

* add ability to undo transaction sets - long term feature that needs libged transactions mechanism
