TODO List for integrating MGED features into Archer

Intended as a "list of work to be done" for porting MGED features to Archer.  The absence of a feature
does not necessarily mean it is intended that this feature be added, particularly for "minor" features
or features that are currently not working well in MGED to start with - these are primarly discussion
points.

Starting with a "walkthrough" of the MGED menu:

     MGED Feature                   |         Archer Status of Feature or Alternative to Feature

Import Database	                    |    dbconcat available on command line, no menu options as in MGED
Export Database                     |    keep available on command line, no GUI menu options
Load Script                         |    no GUI dialog available, presumably command line works?
Raytrace Control Panel              |    older version in Archer, needs updating to current MGED

                                    |    more needed?  Not clear.

Other Issues
------------

* documentation (even for windows) should not be a .chm file in our
  repository.  the documentation should be generated from docbook
  source formatting.

* archer html documentation refers to an 'ae' command, yet only 'aet'
  exists.  either the docs need updating or ae added.

* archer help menu incorrectly calls archer commands "BRL-CAD Commands"

* opendb command doesn't seem to be available.

* archer reports "invalid command" on 'aet' and other commands until a
  database is opened.  it shouldn't.

* archer doesn't have the -c option to run command-line or sans Tk

* need to "port" archer to the C code startup that MGED uses

* get Undo support fleshed out


Tests to Pass
-------------

* The merged Archer/MGED app needs to be able to pass all the regression
  tests currently passed by MGED
