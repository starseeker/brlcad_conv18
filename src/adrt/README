ADRT consists of 2 tools RISE (Realistic Image Synthesis Engine) and 
IVAT (Interactive Vulnerability Analysis Tool).  Both tools consist of 
(3) binaries, a master, an observer, and a slave.  To generate a framework
that RISE and IVAT can use then use the g-adrt converter.  g-adrt takes a
.g file containing bots and creates an ADRT framework.

Below is an example of how to launch IVAT from the command line:


Method 1 - Manually Connecting Compute Nodes
============================================
Step 1.
  ivat_master /path/to/project.env

Step 2.
  ivat_observer master.host.name

Step 3.
  ivat_slave master.host.name

Step 4.
  repeat step 3 on all slave nodes.


Method 2 - Connecting to Slave Daemons
============================================
Step 1.
  login to each compute node and run ivat_slave& (background process).

Step 2.
  ivat_master -l slaves.txt /path/to/project.env
  (slaves.txt contains each slave hostname per line).

Step 3.
  ivat_observer master.host.name


Since RISE is used for generating images, the observer is only supplied 
to check up on the images progress, which is especially useful for time 
consuming renderings.

Running configure with --enable-optimized is very important as it will 
affect performance by almost doubling performance.

To learn more about how the structure of a project file and what 
geometry files you can feed to ivat or rise please check the doc 
directory for help with RISE and IVAT.
