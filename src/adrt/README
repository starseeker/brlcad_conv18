ADRT consists of 2 tools RISE (Realistic Image Synthesis Engine) and 
IGVT (Interactive Geometry Visualization Tool).  Both tools consist of 
(3) binaries, a master, an observer, and slave.  Below is an example of 
how to launch IGVT from the command line:

Method 1 - Manually Connecting Compute Nodes
============================================
Step 1.
  igvt_master -p /path/to/project -g /path/to/project/geometry.file

Step 2.
  igvt_observer -H master.host.name

Step 3.
  igvt_slave -H master.host.name

Step 4.
  repeat step 3 on all slave nodes.


Method 2 - Connecting to Slave Daemons
============================================
Step 1.
  login to each compute node and run igvt_slave& (background process).

Step 2.
  igvt_master -p /path/to/project -g /path/to/project/geometry.file -l 
  slaves.txt (slaves.txt contains each slave hostname per line).

Step 3.
  igvt_observer -H master.host.name


Since RISE is used for generating images, the observer is only supplied 
to check up on the images progress, which is especially useful for time 
consuming renderings.

Running configure with --enable-optimized is very important as it will 
affect performance by almost doubling performance.

To learn more about how the structure of a project file and what 
geometry files you can feed to igvt or rise please check the doc 
directory for help with RISE and IGVT.
