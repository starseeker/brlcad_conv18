ADRT consists of several libraries and tools including the Realistic
Image Synthesis Engine (RISE).  These tools consist of (3) binaries: a
master, an observer, and a slave.  To generate a framework that RISE
can use, look at the g-adrt converter.  g-adrt takes a .g file
containing bots and creates an ADRT framework.

Since RISE is used for generating images, the observer is only supplied 
to check up on the images progress, which is especially useful for time 
consuming renderings.

Running configure with --enable-optimized is very important as it will 
affect performance by almost doubling performance.

To learn more about how the structure of a project file and what 
geometry files you can feed to ivat or rise please check the doc 
directory for help with RISE.

For additional help please check out the #brlcad channel on IRC (freenode).
