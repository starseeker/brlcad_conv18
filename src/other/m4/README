M4 - original sources:
http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/usr.bin/m4/

This is an extraction of the NetBSD port of the OpenBSD
implementation of m4, with just enough extra files to
make it (hopefully) buildable on different systems.  NetBSD
did most of it, but a few extra files and definitions have
been added and we will make any additional portability tweeks
that are needed - flex relies heavily on m4 and getting a
minimal m4 working from NetBSD looked to be the least ardious
of the various options - the code is ~280K uncompressed so it
isn't terribly huge.

The generated files are the results of running flex and
byacc on the parser.y and tokenizer.l files.  Unfortunately,
since the main point of this m4 is to be able to boostrap
a modern flex, at least the tokenizer.l file must be present
in compilable form without assuming lex already present. (This
is a true bootstrap scenario, so there is no way out of it - if
I understand the comments from the OpenBSD commit of the relevant 
m4 update correctly, it requires quite a modern m4 to compile flex.)
The parser.y file might be able to use byacc once we get that
up and running, but for now all lex/yacc files are built using
their pre-generated sources.
