This directory must exist to use the configure installation script for
SCL. Configure (located in the top-level SCL directory) installs all
the NIST STEP Toolset software for you. You can use configure to
install the NIST STEP Toolset as many times as you wish using the
configuration options you choose under an arch directory name you
supply. For details on running configure see the file ../INSTALL

sclprefixes.h.OrbixStore - #defines macros used all over SCL to
	handle namespacing for SCL (for the Orbix and ObjectStore
	version of SCL). This file is not #included directly by SCL
	(see <ARCH_DIR>/scl_prefixes.h below).

sclprefixes.h.noOrbixStore - #defines macros used all over SCL to
	handle namespacing for SCL (for the version of SCL that
	doesn't use Orbix or ObjectStore). This file is not #included
	directly by SCL (see <ARCH_DIR>/scl_prefixes.h below).

<ARCH_DIR>/sclprefixes.h - a copy of one of the above #included in
	much SCL source code. It is created (copied) under the
	<ARCH_DIR> directory created by the configure installation
	script.
