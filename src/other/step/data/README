ap203edit.exp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wg3n916_ap203.exp, the standard version of the ap203 schema, references the
non-existant type "CONFIG_CONTROL_DESIGN.DERIVED_UNIT" in the function
"derive_dimensional_exponents." This error prevents the schema from being
successfully used as an input to fedex_plus.

ap203edit.exp is a corrected version of wg3n916_ap203.exp that removes the
undefined reference.
