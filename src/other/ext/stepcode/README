STEPcode is a set of tools and libraries for reading ISO10303-11 EXPRESS
schemas and generating C++ source code that can read and write Part 21 files
conforming to that schema.

The code is originally from the NIST STEP Class Libraries (SCL) written in the
1990s.  Various contributors hav updated it since then - see the AUTHORS file
for more info.

For license details, see the COPYING file. Summary: 3-clause BSD.

This particular version of stepcode lacks some of the changes made to the
repository at https://github.com/stepcode/stepcode  - users are advised to
check that copy first to see if it will meet their needs.  This copy has
been stripped down to a minimal core for supporting BRL-CAD's needs (in
particular, we don't include the python logic, testing, or most of the schema
files.)

Its headers have been rearranged somewhat, and assume a particular stepcode/<lib>
installed hierarchy when defining includes.  This is a bit more verbose, but
makes it immediately clear which library a given header is associated with.
Given that the headers of core, dai, and editor are rather intertwined this
approach adds a little clarity to which logic and types are coming from where.
