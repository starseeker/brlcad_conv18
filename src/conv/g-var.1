.SH NAME
g-var \- Produce (OpenGL) Vertex Arrays from BOT BRLCAD geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-var
[-v] [-y] [-s scale] [-f] [-o outfile] infile.g object
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-var
writes the bag of triangle (BOT) primitives of the specified
.I object
in a binary array format to
.I outfile
or to
.I stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Request verbose output.
.TP
.B \-y
Transform the coordinate system from xyz to xzy.
.TP 
.B \-s scale
Scale the output geometry by factor
.B scale
\. By default the scale factor is 0.001 (standard transformation
from meters to millimeters.)
.TP
.B \-f
Flip face normals. This changes both the vertex order and the output normals.
.TP
.B \-o outfile
The output will be written to
.B outfile
\. By default the output is written to stdout.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.I TODO
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS

.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
