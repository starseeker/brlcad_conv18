This directory contains scripts to perform the regression testing of the
BRL-CAD package.

Every night the "master.sh" script is run on a single machine.  This deletes
all files under the regression directory (by default "/c/regress").  It then
checks out a copy of the target "brlcad" from /c/CVS.  For each architecture
it creates a semaphore file "start_ARCH" (eg. start_7d).  
Usage:

	master.sh -d regression_dir [-c cvs_binary] [-R cvs_repository]

The "client_wait.sh" script runs on each test architecture and waits for the
semaphore file to be created.  It also will not run past a cutoff time.
Usage:
	./client_wait.sh -d regression_dir [-r brlcad_root] [-b begin_time] \
	[-e end_time] [-u notify_user]

When the client_wait.sh script detects that it is ok to run the regression
test, it starts the client_build.sh script.


When the client_build.sh script finishes it starts the client_test.sh to
actually test the package.




Sean's Notes::

The master.sh script may be run from any machine requesting regression tests to occur for any or all of the test machines listed in systems.d.  Depending on the architecture, the regressing machine may work on a copy of the brlcad package provided from 1) cvs, 2) a tar.gz, or 3) cvs and a tar.gz diff.  The package is then either worked on locally over nfs or copied to the remote machine via ssh.

For each requested machine (default is all), a semaphore lock is independantly acquired.  If a lock was successful, then the client.sh script will run on the test architecture.  The client.sh script will wait until it is ok to run (within a timeout) and then runs client_build.sh to build the package cleanly.  If all builds well, client_test.sh is then run and any or all scripts listed in tests.d will exercise different capabilities of the package.

Results are logged to files and summarys are individually mailed out as specified for each systems.d architecture.

Regression testing is a process of testing chances to computer programs to make sure that the older programming still works with the new changes.  Regression testing is a normal part of the program development process and, in some companies, is done by code testing specialists.  Test department coders develop code test scenarios and exercises that will test new units of code after they have been written.  These test cases form what becomes the `test bucket'.  Before a new version of a software product is released, the old test cases are run against the new version to make sure that all the old capabilities still work.  The reason they might notwork is because changing or adding new code to a program can easily introduce errors into code that is not intended to be changed.

When the "client.sh" script runs, it waits for the semaphore file to be
created.  It also will not run past a cutoff time of 7am.  This cutoff time
can be set on the command line.  Running "client.sh 24" will allow the script
to run at any time.  When the semaphore file is detected, it is deleted, and
the script begins building BRLCAD from the sources.  When the sources are
built, a series of regression scripts are run to try to assure correct
functionality.  For a list of the scripts that are run, see "client.sh" in the
"ASSURANCE TESTING" section.

When client.sh is done, it mails the results of the build and test to the
"acst" mailing list.
