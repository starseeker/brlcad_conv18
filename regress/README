This directory contains scripts to perform the regression testing of the
BRL-CAD package.

Every night the "master.sh" script is run on a single machine.  This deletes
all files under the regression directory (by default "/c/regress").  It then
checks out a copy of the target "brlcad" from /c/CVS.  For each architecture
it creates a semaphore file "start_ARCH" (eg. start_7d).  

When the "client.sh" script runs, it waits for the semaphore file to be
created.  It also will not run past a cutoff time of 7am.  This cutoff time
can be set on the command line.  Running "client.sh 24" will allow the script
to run at any time.  When the semaphore file is detected, it is deleted, and
the script begins building BRLCAD from the sources.  When the sources are
built, a series of regression scripts are run to try to assure correct
functionality.  For a list of the scripts that are run, see "client.sh" in the
"ASSURANCE TESTING" section.

When client.sh is done, it mails the results of the build and test to the
"acst" mailing list.
